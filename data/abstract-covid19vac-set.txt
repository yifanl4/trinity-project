An epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans, which appeared in Wuhan, 
China in December 2019, was caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). This 
disease was named as "Coronavirus Disease 2019" (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 was first 
identified as an etiological pathogen of COVID-19, belonging to the species of 
severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV). The speed 
of both the geographical transmission and the sudden increase in numbers of 
cases is much faster than SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 
COVID-19 is the first global pandemic caused by a coronavirus, which outbreaks 
in 211 countries/territories/areas. The vaccine against COVID-19, regarded as an 
effective prophylactic strategy for control and prevention, is being developed 
in about 90 institutions worldwide. The experiences and lessons encountered in 
the previous SARS and MERS vaccine research can be used for reference in the 
development of COVID-19 vaccine. The present paper hopes to provide some 
insights for COVID-19 vaccines researchers.

The current COVID-19 pandemic has urged the scientific community internationally 
to find answers in terms of therapeutics and vaccines to control SARS-CoV-2. 
Published investigations mostly on SARS-CoV and to some extent on MERS has 
taught lessons on vaccination strategies to this novel coronavirus. This is 
attributed to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV on the 
host cell i.e. human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) and is 
approximately 79% similar genetically to SARS-CoV. Though the efforts on 
COVID-19 vaccines started very early, initially in China, as soon as the 
outbreak of novel coronavirus erupted and then world-over as the disease was 
declared a pandemic by WHO. But we will not be having an effective COVID-19 
vaccine before September, 2020 as per very optimistic estimates. This is because 
a successful COVID-19 vaccine will require a cautious validation of efficacy and 
adverse reactivity as the target vaccinee population include high-risk 
individuals over the age of 60, particularly those with chronic co-morbid 
conditions, frontline healthcare workers and those involved in essentials 
industries. Various platforms for vaccine development are available namely: 
virus vectored vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, genetic vaccines, and 
monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization which are under evaluations for 
SARS-CoV-2, with each having discrete benefits and hindrances. The COVID-19 
pandemic which probably is the most devastating one in the last 100 years after 
Spanish flu mandates the speedy evaluation of the multiple approaches for 
competence to elicit protective immunity and safety to curtail unwanted 
immune-potentiation which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this 
virus. This review is aimed at providing an overview of the efforts dedicated to 
an effective vaccine for this novel coronavirus which has crippled the world in 
terms of economy, human health and life.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most formidable challenge 
to humanity in a century. It is widely believed that prepandemic normalcy will 
never return until a safe and effective vaccine strategy becomes available and a 
global vaccination programme is implemented successfully. Here, we discuss the 
immunological principles that need to be taken into consideration in the 
development of COVID-19 vaccine strategies. On the basis of these principles, we 
examine the current COVID-19 vaccine candidates, their strengths and potential 
shortfalls, and make inferences about their chances of success. Finally, we 
discuss the scientific and practical challenges that will be faced in the 
process of developing a successful vaccine and the ways in which COVID-19 
vaccine strategies may evolve over the next few years.

BACKGROUND: A vaccine to protect against COVID-19 is urgently needed. We aimed 
to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant 
adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine expressing the spike 
glycoprotein of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
strain.
METHODS: We did a dose-escalation, single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, 
phase 1 trial of an Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in Wuhan, China. Healthy 
adults aged between 18 and 60 years were sequentially enrolled and allocated to 
one of three dose groups (5 × 1010, 1 × 1011, and 1·5 × 1011 viral particles) to 
receive an intramuscular injection of vaccine. The primary outcome was adverse 
events in the 7 days post-vaccination. Safety was assessed over 28 days 
post-vaccination. Specific antibodies were measured with ELISA, and the 
neutralising antibody responses induced by vaccination were detected with 
SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation and pseudovirus neutralisation tests. T-cell 
responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot and flow-cytometry assays. 
This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04313127.
FINDINGS: Between March 16 and March 27, 2020, we screened 195 individuals for 
eligibility. Of them, 108 participants (51% male, 49% female; mean age 36·3 
years) were recruited and received the low dose (n=36), middle dose (n=36), or 
high dose (n=36) of the vaccine. All enrolled participants were included in the 
analysis. At least one adverse reaction within the first 7 days after the 
vaccination was reported in 30 (83%) participants in the low dose group, 30 
(83%) participants in the middle dose group, and 27 (75%) participants in the 
high dose group. The most common injection site adverse reaction was pain, which 
was reported in 58 (54%) vaccine recipients, and the most commonly reported 
systematic adverse reactions were fever (50 [46%]), fatigue (47 [44%]), headache 
(42 [39%]), and muscle pain (18 [17%]. Most adverse reactions that were reported 
in all dose groups were mild or moderate in severity. No serious adverse event 
was noted within 28 days post-vaccination. ELISA antibodies and neutralising 
antibodies increased significantly at day 14, and peaked 28 days 
post-vaccination. Specific T-cell response peaked at day 14 post-vaccination.
INTERPRETATION: The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine is tolerable and immunogenic 
at 28 days post-vaccination. Humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 peaked at day 
28 post-vaccination in healthy adults, and rapid specific T-cell responses were 
noted from day 14 post-vaccination. Our findings suggest that the Ad5 vectored 
COVID-19 vaccine warrants further investigation.

In the race for a safe and effective vaccine against coronavirus disease 
(COVID)-19, pharmaceutical formulation science plays a critical role throughout 
the development, manufacturing, distribution, and vaccination phases. The proper 
choice of the type of vaccine, carrier or vector, adjuvant, excipients, dosage 
form, and route of administration can directly impact not only the immune 
responses induced and the resultant efficacy against COVID-19, but also the 
logistics of manufacturing, storing and distributing the vaccine, and mass 
vaccination. In this review, we described the COVID-19 vaccines that are 
currently tested in clinical trials and provided in-depth insight into the 
various types of vaccines, their compositions, advantages, and potential 
limitations. We also addressed how challenges in vaccine distribution and 
administration may be alleviated by applying vaccine-stabilization strategies 
and the use of specific mucosal immune response-inducing, non-invasive routes of 
administration, which must be considered early in the development process.

Previous work on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 
vaccines identified cellular immunopathology and antibody-dependent enhancement 
as potential safety issues. We discuss the implications of these findings for 
COVID-19 vaccine development and our approach to optimizing for safety and 
efficacy.

Here, Hotez and colleagues highlight the two ‘faces’ of immune enhancement that 
could impact COVID-19 vaccine design.

Seven years after the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak, a new 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) made its first 
appearance in a food market in Wuhan, China, drawing an entirely new course to 
our lives. As the virus belongs to the same genus of MERS and SARS, researchers 
have been trying to draw lessons from previous outbreaks to find a potential 
cure. Although there were five Phase I human vaccine trials against SARS and 
MERS, the lack of data in humans provided us with limited benchmarks that could 
help us design a new vaccine for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this 
review, we showcase the similarities in structures of virus components between 
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in areas relevant to vaccine design. Using 
the ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization (WHO) databases, we shed 
light on the 16 current approved clinical trials worldwide in search for a 
COVID-19 vaccine. The different vaccine platforms being tested are Bacillus 
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccines, DNA and RNA-based vaccines, inactivated 
vaccines, protein subunits, and viral vectors. By thoroughly analyzing different 
trials and platforms, we also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using 
each type of vaccine and how they can contribute to the design of an adequate 
vaccine for COVID-19. Studying past efforts invested in conducting vaccine 
trials for MERS and SARS will provide vital insights regarding the best approach 
to designing an effective vaccine against COVID-19.

The pandemic spread of a novel coronavirus - SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as 
a cause of acute respiratory illness, named Covid-19, is placing the healthcare 
systems of many countries under unprecedented stress. Global economies are also 
spiraling towards a recession in fear of this new life-threatening disease. 
Vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapeutics that reduces the 
risk of severe Covid-19 are thus urgently needed. A rapid method to derive 
antiviral treatment for Covid-19 is the use of convalescent plasma derived 
hyperimmune globulin. However, both hyperimmune globulin and vaccine development 
face a common hurdle - the risk of antibody-mediated disease enhancement. The 
goal of this review is to examine the body of evidence supporting the hypothesis 
of immune enhancement that could be pertinent to Covid-19. We also discuss how 
this risk could be mitigated so that both hyperimmune globulin and vaccines 
could be rapidly translated to overcome the current global health crisis.

A close interaction between the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system of an 
individual results in a diverse clinical manifestation of the COVID-19 disease. 
While adaptive immune responses are essential for SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance, 
the innate immune cells, such as macrophages, may contribute, in some cases, to 
the disease progression. Macrophages have shown a significant production of 
IL-6, suggesting they may contribute to the excessive inflammation in COVID-19 
disease. Macrophage Activation Syndrome may further explain the high serum 
levels of CRP, which are normally lacking in viral infections. In adaptive 
immune responses, it has been revealed that cytotoxic CD8+ T cells exhibit 
functional exhaustion patterns, such as the expression of NKG2A, PD-1, and 
TIM-3. Since SARS-CoV-2 restrains antigen presentation by downregulating MHC 
class I and II molecules and, therefore, inhibits the T cell-mediated immune 
responses, humoral immune responses also play a substantial role. Specific IgA 
response appears to be stronger and more persistent than the IgM response. 
Moreover, IgM and IgG antibodies show similar dynamics in COVID-19 disease.

There is an urgent need for effective countermeasures against the current 
emergence and accelerating expansion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
Induction of herd immunity by mass vaccination has been a very successful 
strategy for preventing the spread of many infectious diseases, hence protecting 
the most vulnerable population groups unable to develop immunity, for example 
individuals with immunodeficiencies or a weakened immune system due to 
underlying medical or debilitating conditions. Therefore, vaccination represents 
one of the most promising counter-pandemic measures to COVID-19. However, to 
date, no licensed vaccine exists, neither for SARS-CoV-2 nor for the closely 
related SARS-CoV or Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV. In addition, a few 
vaccine candidates have only recently entered human clinical trials, which 
hampers the progress in tackling COVID-19 infection. Here, we discuss potential 
prophylactic interventions for SARS-CoV-2 with a focus on the challenges 
existing for vaccine development, and we review pre-clinical progress and 
ongoing human clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Although COVID-19 
vaccine development is currently accelerated via so-called fast-track programs, 
vaccines may not be timely available to have an impact on the first wave of the 
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, COVID-19 vaccines will be essential in 
the future for reducing morbidity and mortality and inducing herd immunity, if 
SARS-CoV-2 becomes established in the population like for example influenza 
virus.

The COVID-19 pandemic has infected millions of people with no clear signs of 
abatement owing to the high prevalence, long incubation period and lack of 
established treatments or vaccines. Vaccines are the most promising solution to 
mitigate new viral strains. The genome sequence and protein structure of the 
2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) were made available in record time, 
allowing the development of inactivated or attenuated viral vaccines along with 
subunit vaccines for prophylaxis and treatment. Nanotechnology benefits modern 
vaccine design since nanomaterials are ideal for antigen delivery, as adjuvants, 
and as mimics of viral structures. In fact, the first vaccine candidate launched 
into clinical trials is an mRNA vaccine delivered via lipid nanoparticles. To 
eradicate pandemics, present and future, a successful vaccine platform must 
enable rapid discovery, scalable manufacturing and global distribution. Here, we 
review current approaches to COVID-19 vaccine development and highlight the role 
of nanotechnology and advanced manufacturing.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which causes serious respiratory illness 
such as pneumonia and lung failure, was first reported in Wuhan, the capital of 
Hubei, China. The etiological agent of COVID-19 has been confirmed as a novel 
coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2), which is most likely originated from zoonotic coronaviruses, like 
SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002. Within a few months of the first report, 
SARS-CoV-2 had spread across China and worldwide, reaching a pandemic level. As 
COVID-19 has triggered enormous human casualties and serious economic loss 
posing global threat, an understanding of the ongoing situation and the 
development of strategies to contain the virus's spread are urgently needed. 
Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available and 
several repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 have shown to be clinically 
effective. In addition, global institutions and companies have begun to develop 
vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19. Here, we review the current status of 
epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development for COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic is due to infection caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus 
that impacts the lower respiratory tract. The spectrum of symptoms ranges from 
asymptomatic infections to mild respiratory symptoms to the lethal form of 
COVID-19 which is associated with severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, 
and fatality. To address this global crisis, up-to-date information on viral 
genomics and transcriptomics is crucial for understanding the origins and global 
dispersion of the virus, providing insights into viral pathogenicity, 
transmission, and epidemiology, and enabling strategies for therapeutic 
interventions, drug discovery, and vaccine development. Therefore, this review 
provides a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 epidemiology, genomic etiology, 
findings from recent transcriptomic map analysis, viral-human protein 
interactions, molecular diagnostics, and the current status of vaccine and novel 
therapeutic intervention development. Moreover, we provide an extensive list of 
resources that will help the scientific community access numerous types of 
databases related to SARS-CoV-2 OMICs and approaches to therapeutics related to 
COVID-19 treatment.

Understanding adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is important for vaccine 
development, interpreting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis, and 
calibration of pandemic control measures. Using HLA class I and II predicted 
peptide "megapools," circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were 
identified in ∼70% and 100% of COVID-19 convalescent patients, respectively. 
CD4+ T cell responses to spike, the main target of most vaccine efforts, were 
robust and correlated with the magnitude of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA 
titers. The M, spike, and N proteins each accounted for 11%-27% of the total 
CD4+ response, with additional responses commonly targeting nsp3, nsp4, ORF3a, 
and ORF8, among others. For CD8+ T cells, spike and M were recognized, with at 
least eight SARS-CoV-2 ORFs targeted. Importantly, we detected 
SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in ∼40%-60% of unexposed individuals, 
suggesting cross-reactive T cell recognition between circulating "common cold" 
coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2.

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a global challenge. 
Despite intense research efforts worldwide, an effective vaccine and viable 
treatment options have eluded investigators. Therefore, infection prevention, 
early viral detection and identification of successful treatment protocols 
provide the best approach in controlling disease spread. In this review, current 
therapeutic options, preventive methods and transmission routes of COVID-19 are 
discussed.

The Novel corona virus 2019 which started as an outbreak in China in December 
2019 has rapidly spread all over the world, such that on 11th March 2020 WHO 
declared this disease as pandemic. The emergency that the world faces today 
demands that we develop urgent and effective measures to protect people at high 
risk of transmission. WHO has accelerated research in diagnostics, vaccines and 
therapeutics for this novel coronavirus.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel coronavirus severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and first emerged in 
December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Since then, the virus has rapidly 
spread to many countries. While the outbreak in China appears to be in decline, 
the disease has spread across the world, with a daily increase in the number of 
confirmed cases and infection-related deaths. Here, we highlight (i) the lessons 
that have been learnt so far and how they will benefit reducing the impact of 
COVID-19 disease and (ii) an update on the status of drug treatment and vaccine 
development to prevent COVID-19 and potential future related pandemics. Although 
the mortality rate is clearly higher than for influenza, the rate does seem to 
vary from country to country, possibly reflecting differences in how rapidly 
local health authorities respond to isolate and effectively care for the 
affected population. Drugs are urgently needed for both prophylaxis and the 
treatment of severely ill patients; however, no proven effective therapies for 
SARS-CoV-2 currently exist. A number of drugs that have been approved for other 
diseases are being tested for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, but there is 
an absence of data from appropriately designed clinical trials showing that 
these drugs, either alone or in combination, will prove effective. There is also 
a global urgency to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, but development and 
appropriate testing will take at least a year before such a vaccine will be 
globally available. This review summarizes the lessons learnt so far from the 
COVID-19 pandemic, examines the evidence regarding the drugs that are being 
tested for the treatment of COVID19, and describes the progress made in efforts 
to develop an effective vaccine.

Since its emergence in December 2019, it took only a couple of months for an 
outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to be declared a 
pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). This along with the highly 
infectious nature of the disease and the associated mortality call for 
particular attention to the underlying (immuno)pathomechanism(s). The latter 
will inform case management and vaccine design. Unravelling these mechanisms can 
assist basic scientists, laboratory medicine practitioners, clinicians, public 
health practitioners, funding agencies, and health care policymakers in 
responding to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
pandemic.

The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has potential to disproportionately and 
severely affect patients with neuromuscular disorders. In a short period of 
time, it has already caused reorganization of neuromuscular clinical care 
delivery and education, which will likely have lasting effects on the field. 
This article reviews (1) potential neuromuscular complications of COVID-19, (2) 
assessment and mitigation of COVID-19-related risk for patients with preexisting 
neuromuscular disease, (3) guidance for management of immunosuppressive and 
immunomodulatory therapies, (4) practical guidance regarding neuromuscular care 
delivery, telemedicine, and education, and (5) effect on neuromuscular research. 
We outline key unanswered clinical questions and highlight the need for 
team-based and interspecialty collaboration. Primary goals of clinical research 
during this time are to develop evidence-based best practices and to minimize 
morbidity and mortality related to COVID-19 for patients with neuromuscular 
disorders.

A SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) recombinant protein was developed and 
manufactured under current good manufacturing practices in 2016. The protein, 
known as RBD219-N1 when formulated on Alhydrogel®, induced high-level 
neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity with minimal immunopathology in 
mice after a homologous virus challenge with SARS-CoV (MA15 strain). We examined 
published evidence in support of whether the SARS-CoV RBD219-N1 could be 
repurposed as a heterologous vaccine against Coronavirus Infectious Disease 
(COVID)-19. Our findings include evidence that convalescent serum from SARS-CoV 
patients can neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, a review of published studies 
using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against SARS-CoV RBD and that 
neutralizes the SARS-CoV virus in vitro finds that some of these mAbs bind to 
the receptor-binding motif (RBM) within the RBD, while others bind to domains 
outside this region within RBD. This information is relevant and supports the 
possibility of developing a heterologous SARS-CoV RBD vaccine against COVID-19, 
especially due to the finding that the overall high amino acid similarity (82%) 
between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD domains is not reflected in RBM 
amino acid similarity (59%). However, the high sequence similarity (94%) in the 
region outside of RBM offers the potential of conserved neutralizing epitopes 
between both viruses.

Eosinophils are circulating and tissue-resident leukocytes that have potent 
proinflammatory effects in a number of diseases. Recently, eosinophils have been 
shown to have various other functions, including immunoregulation and antiviral 
activity. Eosinophil levels vary dramatically in a number of clinical settings, 
especially following eosinophil-targeted therapy, which is now available to 
selectively deplete these cells. There are key coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19)-related questions concerning eosinophils whose answers affect 
recommended prevention and care. First, do patients with eosinophilia-associated 
diseases have an altered course of COVID-19? Second, do patients with 
eosinopenia (now intentionally induced by biological drugs) have unique COVID-19 
susceptibility and/or disease course? This is a particularly relevant question 
because eosinopenia is associated with acute respiratory deterioration during 
infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the 
causative agent of COVID-19. Third, do eosinophils contribute to the lung 
pathology induced during COVID-19 and will they contribute to immunopotentiation 
potentially associated with emerging COVID-19 vaccines? Herein, we address these 
timely questions and project considerations during the emerging COVID-19 
pandemic.

BACKGROUND: This is the first randomised controlled trial for assessment of the 
immunogenicity and safety of a candidate non-replicating adenovirus type-5 
(Ad5)-vectored COVID-19 vaccine, aiming to determine an appropriate dose of the 
candidate vaccine for an efficacy study.
METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of the 
Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine was done in a single centre in Wuhan, China. 
Healthy adults aged 18 years or older, who were HIV-negative and previous severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-free, were 
eligible to participate and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine at a 
dose of 1 × 1011 viral particles per mL or 5 × 1010 viral particles per mL, or 
placebo. Investigators allocated participants at a ratio of 2:1:1 to receive a 
single injection intramuscularly in the arm. The randomisation list (block size 
4) was generated by an independent statistician. Participants, investigators, 
and staff undertaking laboratory analyses were masked to group allocation. The 
primary endpoints for immunogenicity were the geometric mean titres (GMTs) of 
specific ELISA antibody responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and 
neutralising antibody responses at day 28. The primary endpoint for safety 
evaluation was the incidence of adverse reactions within 14 days. All recruited 
participants who received at least one dose were included in the primary and 
safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04341389.
FINDINGS: 603 volunteers were recruited and screened for eligibility between 
April 11 and 16, 2020. 508 eligible participants (50% male; mean age 39·7 years, 
SD 12·5) consented to participate in the trial and were randomly assigned to 
receive the vaccine (1 × 1011 viral particles n=253; 5 × 1010 viral particles 
n=129) or placebo (n=126). In the 1 × 1011 and 5 × 1010 viral particles dose 
groups, the RBD-specific ELISA antibodies peaked at 656·5 (95% CI 575·2-749·2) 
and 571·0 (467·6-697·3), with seroconversion rates at 96% (95% CI 93-98) and 97% 
(92-99), respectively, at day 28. Both doses of the vaccine induced significant 
neutralising antibody responses to live SARS-CoV-2, with GMTs of 19·5 (95% CI 
16·8-22·7) and 18·3 (14·4-23·3) in participants receiving 1 × 1011 and 5 × 1010 
viral particles, respectively. Specific interferon γ enzyme-linked immunospot 
assay responses post vaccination were observed in 227 (90%, 95% CI 85-93) of 253 
and 113 (88%, 81-92) of 129 participants in the 1 × 1011 and 5 × 1010 viral 
particles dose groups, respectively. Solicited adverse reactions were reported 
by 183 (72%) of 253 and 96 (74%) of 129 participants in the 1 × 1011 and 
5 × 1010 viral particles dose groups, respectively. Severe adverse reactions 
were reported by 24 (9%) participants in the 1 × 1011 viral particles dose group 
and one (1%) participant in the 5 × 1010 viral particles dose group. No serious 
adverse reactions were documented.
INTERPRETATION: The Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine at 5 × 1010 viral particles is 
safe, and induced significant immune responses in the majority of recipients 
after a single immunisation.

There is a strong consensus globally that a COVID-19 vaccine is likely the most 
effective approach to sustainably controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. An 
unprecedented research effort and global coordination has resulted in a rapid 
development of vaccine candidates and initiation of trials. Here, we review 
vaccine types, and progress with 10 vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 - the 
virus that causes COVID-19 - currently undergoing early phase human trials. We 
also consider the many challenges of developing and deploying a new vaccine on a 
global scale, and recommend caution with respect to our expectations of the 
timeline that may be ahead.

As scientists consider SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design, we discuss problems that may 
be encountered and how to tackle them by what we term "rational vaccine design." 
We further discuss approaches to pan-coronavirus vaccines. We draw on 
experiences from recent research on several viruses including HIV and influenza, 
as well as coronaviruses.

BACKGROUND: We developed a heterologous COVID-19 vaccine consisting of two 
components, a recombinant adenovirus type 26 (rAd26) vector and a recombinant 
adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) vector, both carrying the gene for severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein (rAd26-S and 
rAd5-S). We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two formulations 
(frozen and lyophilised) of this vaccine.
METHODS: We did two open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies at two hospitals in 
Russia. We enrolled healthy adult volunteers (men and women) aged 18-60 years to 
both studies. In phase 1 of each study, we administered intramuscularly on day 0 
either one dose of rAd26-S or one dose of rAd5-S and assessed the safety of the 
two components for 28 days. In phase 2 of the study, which began no earlier than 
5 days after phase 1 vaccination, we administered intramuscularly a prime-boost 
vaccination, with rAd26-S given on day 0 and rAd5-S on day 21. Primary outcome 
measures were antigen-specific humoral immunity (SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies 
measured by ELISA on days 0, 14, 21, 28, and 42) and safety (number of 
participants with adverse events monitored throughout the study). Secondary 
outcome measures were antigen-specific cellular immunity (T-cell responses and 
interferon-γ concentration) and change in neutralising antibodies (detected with 
a SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay). These trials are registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04436471 and NCT04437875.
FINDINGS: Between June 18 and Aug 3, 2020, we enrolled 76 participants to the 
two studies (38 in each study). In each study, nine volunteers received rAd26-S 
in phase 1, nine received rAd5-S in phase 1, and 20 received rAd26-S and rAd5-S 
in phase 2. Both vaccine formulations were safe and well tolerated. The most 
common adverse events were pain at injection site (44 [58%]), hyperthermia (38 
[50%]), headache (32 [42%]), asthenia (21 [28%]), and muscle and joint pain (18 
[24%]). Most adverse events were mild and no serious adverse events were 
detected. All participants produced antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein. At 
day 42, receptor binding domain-specific IgG titres were 14 703 with the frozen 
formulation and 11 143 with the lyophilised formulation, and neutralising 
antibodies were 49·25 with the frozen formulation and 45·95 with the lyophilised 
formulation, with a seroconversion rate of 100%. Cell-mediated responses were 
detected in all participants at day 28, with median cell proliferation of 2·5% 
CD4+ and 1·3% CD8+ with the frozen formulation, and a median cell proliferation 
of 1·3% CD4+ and 1·1% CD8+ with the lyophilised formulation.
INTERPRETATION: The heterologous rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based COVID-19 vaccine 
has a good safety profile and induced strong humoral and cellular immune 
responses in participants. Further investigation is needed of the effectiveness 
of this vaccine for prevention of COVID-19.

While a human challenge study holds the prospect of accelerating the development 
of a vaccine for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, it may be opposed due to risks of 
harm to participants and researchers. Given the increasing number of human 
deaths and severe disruption to lives worldwide, we argue that a SARS-CoV-2 
challenge study is ethically justifiable as its social value substantially 
outweighs the risks. Such a study should therefore be seriously considered as 
part of the global research response towards the COVID-19 pandemic. In this 
paper, we contribute to the debate by addressing the misperception that a 
challenge study for the coronavirus would lower scientific and ethical standards 
for vaccine research and development, and examine how it could be ethically 
conducted. We also set out information that needs to be disclosed to prospective 
participants to obtain their consent.

The COVID-19 pandemic has not only had a negative impact on people's health and 
life behavior, but also on economies around the world. At the same time, 
laboratories and institutions are working hard to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, 
which we hope will be available soon. However, there has been no assessment of 
whether an individual and society value ​​a vaccine monetarily, and what factors 
determine this value. Therefore, the objective of this research was to estimate 
the individual's willingness to pay (WTP) for a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine 
and, at the same time, find the main factors that determine this valuation. For 
this, we used the contingent valuation approach, in its single and 
double-bounded dichotomous choice format, which was based on a hypothetical 
market for a vaccine. The sample used was obtained through an online survey of 
n = 566 individuals from Chile. The main results showed that the WTP depends on 
the preexistence of chronic disease (p≤0.05), knowledge of COVID-19 (p≤0.05), 
being sick with COVID-19 (p≤0.05), perception of government performance 
(p≤0.01), employment status (p≤0.01), income (p≤0.01), health care (p≤0.05), 
adaptation to quarantine with children at home (p≤0.01) and whether the person 
has recovered from COVID-19 (p≤0.10). According to our discrete choice model in 
double-bounded dichotomous format, it was concluded that the individuals' WTP is 
US$184.72 (CI: 165.52-203.92; p < 0.01). This implies a social valuation of 
approximately US$2232 million, corresponding to 1.09% of the GNP per capita.

SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the outbreak of severe respiratory illness 
(COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China and is now spreading rapidly throughout the 
world. The prompt outbreak of COVID-19 and its quick spread without any 
controllable measure defines the severity of the situation. In this crisis, a 
collective pool of knowledge about the advancement of clinical diagnostic and 
management for COVID-19 is a prerequisite. Here, we summarize all the available 
updates on the multidisciplinary approaches for the advancement of diagnosis and 
proposed therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Moreover, the review discusses 
different aspects of the COVID-19, including its epidemiology; incubation 
period; the general clinical features of patients; the clinical features of 
intensive care unit (ICU) patients; SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of 
co-morbid diseases and the clinical features of pediatric patients infected with 
the SARS-CoV-2. Advances in various diagnostic approaches, such as the use of 
real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest radiography, and computed 
tomography (CT) imaging; and other modern diagnostic methods, for this infection 
have been highlighted. However, due to the unavailability of adequate evidence, 
presently there are no officially approved drugs or vaccines available against 
SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we have discussed various therapeutic strategies for 
COVID-19 under different categories, like the possible treatment plans with drug 
(antiviral drugs and anti-cytokines) therapy for disease prevention. Lastly, 
potentials candidates for the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been 
described. Collectively, the review provides an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 
infection outbreak along with the recent advancements and strategies for 
diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19.

The outbreak of emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) in China has been brought to global attention 
and declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 
2020. Scientific advancements since the pandemic of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS) in 2002~2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 
have accelerated our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of 
SARS-CoV-2 and the development of therapeutics to treat viral infection. As no 
specific therapeutics and vaccines are available for disease control, the 
epidemic of COVID-19 is posing a great threat for global public health. To 
provide a comprehensive summary to public health authorities and potential 
readers worldwide, we detail the present understanding of COVID-19 and introduce 
the current state of development of measures in this review.

The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen that was first 
described in late December 2019 and causes a severe respiratory infection in 
humans. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, international attention has raised to 
develop treatment and control options such as types of immunotherapies. The 
immunotherapy is an effective method for fighting against similar viral 
infections such as SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. These methods include several types 
of vaccines, monoclonal antibody candidates, and etc. This systematic review 
article was designed to evaluate the existing evidence and experience related to 
immunotherapy for 2019-nCoV. Web of Science (ISI), PubMed, and Scopus databases 
were used to search for suitable keywords such as 2019-nCoV, novel coronavirus, 
Immunotherapy, interleukin, vaccine and the related words for relevant 
publications up to 24.3.2020. The present systematic review was performed based 
on PRISMA protocol. Data extraction and quality valuation of articles were 
performed by two reviewers. 51 articles were the results of the search and based 
on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 7 articles were included in the final 
review. As a conclusion of these studies demonstratedthat although no serious 
research has been done on this subject at the time of writing this article, 
similar studies on the related viruses showed notable results. So immunotherapy 
for this virus can also be a suitable option.

Vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 has drawn attention around the globe due 
to the exploding pandemic. Although COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus, 
SARS-CoV-2, previous research on other coronavirus vaccines, such as FIPV, SARS, 
and MERS, has provided valuable information for the rapid development of 
COVID-19 vaccine. However, important knowledge gaps remain - some are specific 
to SARS-CoV-2, others are fundamental to immunology and vaccinology. Here, we 
discuss areas that need to be addressed for COVID-19 vaccine development, and 
what can be learned from examples of vaccine development in the past. Since the 
beginning of the outbreak, the research progress on COVID-19 has been 
remarkable. We are therefore optimistic about the rapid development of COVID-19 
vaccine.

As the world is witnessing the epidemic of COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel 
coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerging genetics and clinical evidences suggest a 
similar path to those of SARS and MERS. The rapid genomic sequencing and open 
access data, together with advanced vaccine technology, are expected to give us 
more knowledge on the pathogen itself, including the host immune response as 
well as the plan for therapeutic vaccines in the near future. This review aims 
to provide a comparative view among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly epidemic 
SARS-CoV-2, in the hope to gain a better understanding of the host-pathogen 
interaction, host immune responses, and the pathogen immune evasion strategies. 
This predictive view may help in designing an immune intervention or preventive 
vaccine for COVID-19 in the near future.

The whole globe is reeling under the COVID-19 pandemic now. With the scale and 
severity of infection, number of deaths and lack of any definite therapeutic 
armamentarium, the vaccine development has been accelerated at a never-before 
pace. A wide variety of vaccine technologies and platforms are being attempted. 
Out of the over 108 efforts, 100 are in preclinical and eight in Phase 1 or 2 
trial stage. While the availability of newer technologies has facilitated 
development, there are several challenges on the way including limited 
understanding of the pathophysiology, targeting humoral or mucosal immunity, 
lack of suitable animal model, poor success of human severe acute respiratory 
syndrome/Middle East Respiratory Syndrome vaccines, limited efficacy of 
influenza vaccines, and immune exaggeration with animal coronavirus vaccines. 
With the current scenario with political, funding, research, and regulatory 
supports, if everything sails through smoothly, the successful vaccine is 
expected in 12-18 months. Modestly efficacious vaccine may be also a good 
achievement.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic in March 
2020. Several prophylactic vaccines against COVID-19 are currently in 
development, yet little is known about people's acceptability of a COVID-19 
vaccine.
METHODS: We conducted an online survey of adults ages 18 and older in the United 
States (n = 2,006) in May 2020. Multivariable relative risk regression 
identified correlates of participants' willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine 
(i.e., vaccine acceptability).
RESULTS: Overall, 69% of participants were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. 
Participants were more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they thought 
their healthcare provider would recommend vaccination (RR = 1.73, 95% CI: 
1.49-2.02) or if they were moderate (RR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.02-1.16) or liberal 
(RR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.07-1.22) in their political leaning. Participants were 
also more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they reported higher levels 
of perceived likelihood getting a COVID-19 infection in the future (RR = 1.05, 
95% CI: 1.01-1.09), perceived severity of COVID-19 infection (RR = 1.08, 95% CI: 
1.04-1.11), or perceived effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine (RR = 1.46, 95% CI: 
1.40-1.52). Participants were less likely to be willing to get vaccinated if 
they were non-Latinx black (RR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.74-0.90) or reported a higher 
level of perceived potential vaccine harms (RR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.98).
CONCLUSIONS: Many adults are willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine, though 
acceptability should be monitored as vaccine development continues. Our findings 
can help guide future efforts to increase COVID-19 vaccine acceptability (and 
uptake if a vaccine becomes available).

Vaccine hesitancy remains a barrier to full population inoculation against 
highly infectious diseases. Coincident with the rapid developments of COVID-19 
vaccines globally, concerns about the safety of such a vaccine could contribute 
to vaccine hesitancy. We analyzed 1941 anonymous questionnaires completed by 
healthcare workers and members of the general Israeli population, regarding 
acceptance of a potential COVID-19 vaccine. Our results indicate that healthcare 
staff involved in the care of COVID-19 positive patients, and individuals 
considering themselves at risk of disease, were more likely to self-report 
acquiescence to COVID-19 vaccination if and when available. In contrast, 
parents, nurses, and medical workers not caring for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients 
expressed higher levels of vaccine hesitancy. Interventional educational 
campaigns targeted towards populations at risk of vaccine hesitancy are 
therefore urgently needed to combat misinformation and avoid low inoculation 
rates.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Healthcare delivery requires the support of new 
technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Big 
Data and Machine Learning to fight and look ahead against the new diseases. We 
aim to review the role of AI as a decisive technology to analyze, prepare us for 
prevention and fight with COVID-19 (Coronavirus) and other pandemics.
METHODS: The rapid review of the literature is done on the database of Pubmed, 
Scopus and Google Scholar using the keyword of COVID-19 or Coronavirus and 
Artificial Intelligence or AI. Collected the latest information regarding AI for 
COVID-19, then analyzed the same to identify its possible application for this 
disease.
RESULTS: We have identified seven significant applications of AI for COVID-19 
pandemic. This technology plays an important role to detect the cluster of cases 
and to predict where this virus will affect in future by collecting and 
analyzing all previous data.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare organizations are in an urgent need for decision-making 
technologies to handle this virus and help them in getting proper suggestions in 
real-time to avoid its spread. AI works in a proficient way to mimic like human 
intelligence. It may also play a vital role in understanding and suggesting the 
development of a vaccine for COVID-19. This result-driven technology is used for 
proper screening, analyzing, prediction and tracking of current patients and 
likely future patients. The significant applications are applied to tracks data 
of confirmed, recovered and death cases.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S., which 
leads globally in total cases and deaths. As COVID-19 vaccines are under 
development, public health officials and policymakers need to create strategic 
vaccine-acceptance messaging to effectively control the pandemic and prevent 
thousands of additional deaths.
METHODS: Using an online platform, we surveyed the U.S. adult population in May 
2020 to understand risk perceptions about the COVID-19 pandemic, acceptance of a 
COVID-19 vaccine, and trust in sources of information. These factors were 
compared across basic demographics.
FINDINGS: Of the 672 participants surveyed, 450 (67%) said they would accept a 
COVID-19 vaccine if it is recommended for them. Males (72%) compared to females, 
older adults (≥55 years; 78%) compared to younger adults, Asians (81%) compared 
to other racial and ethnic groups, and college and/or graduate degree holders 
(75%) compared to people with less than a college degree were more likely to 
accept the vaccine. When comparing reported influenza vaccine uptake to reported 
acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine: 1) participants who did not complete high 
school had a very low influenza vaccine uptake (10%), while 60% of the same 
group said they would accept the COVID-19 vaccine; 2) unemployed participants 
reported lower influenza uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance when 
compared to those employed or retired; and, 3) Black Americans reported lower 
influenza vaccine uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance than all other 
racial groups reported in our study. Lastly, we identified geographic 
differences with Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regions 2 (New 
York) and 5 (Chicago) reporting less than 50 percent COVID-19 vaccine 
acceptance.
INTERPRETATION: Although our study found a 67% acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, 
there were noticeable demographic and geographical disparities in vaccine 
acceptance. Before a COVID-19 vaccine is introduced to the U.S., public health 
officials and policymakers must prioritize effective COVID-19 vaccine-acceptance 
messaging for all Americans, especially those who are most vulnerable.

To ultimately combat the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, it is desired to develop an 
effective and safe vaccine against this highly contagious disease caused by the 
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the 
whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and 
membrane protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and 
MERS. We further used the Vaxign reverse vaccinology tool and the newly 
developed Vaxign-ML machine learning tool to predict COVID-19 vaccine 
candidates. The N protein was found to be conserved in the more pathogenic 
strains (SARS/MERS/COVID-19), but not in the other human coronaviruses that 
mostly cause mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, 
six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 
3CL-pro, and nsp8-10) were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the 
viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also 
predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the 
commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus 
vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found 
to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 
coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted 
to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and linear B-cell 
epitopes localized in specific locations and functional domains of the protein. 
Our predicted vaccine targets provide new strategies for effective and safe 
COVID-19 vaccine development.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently become a pandemic. As the sudden 
emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is endangering global health and the 
economy, the development of strategies to contain the virus's spread are 
urgently needed. At present, various diagnostic kits to test for SARS-CoV-2 are 
available for use to initiate appropriate treatment faster and to limit further 
spread of the virus. Several drugs have demonstrated in vitro activity against 
SARS-CoV-2 or potential clinical benefits. In addition, institutions and 
companies worldwide are working tirelessly to develop treatments and vaccines 
against COVID-19. However, no drug or vaccine has yet been specifically approved 
for COVID-19. Given the urgency of the outbreak, we focus here on recent 
advances in the diagnostics, treatment, and vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 
infection, helping to guide strategies to address the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Update of
    bioRxiv. 2020 Mar 21;:

To ultimately combat the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, it is desired to develop an 
effective and safe vaccine against this highly contagious disease caused by the 
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the 
whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and 
membrane (M) protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and 
MERS. However, these vaccine candidates might lack the induction of complete 
protection and have safety concerns. We then applied the Vaxign and the newly 
developed machine learning-based Vaxign-ML reverse vaccinology tools to predict 
COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Our Vaxign analysis found that the SARS-CoV-2 N 
protein sequence is conserved with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but not from the other 
four human coronaviruses causing mild symptoms. By investigating the entire 
proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five 
non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10), were predicted to be 
adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, 
nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high 
protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein 
has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for 
further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, 
SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other 
animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II 
T-cell epitopes, and the predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be 
localized on the surface of the protein. Our predicted vaccine targets have the 
potential for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine development. We also propose 
that an "Sp/Nsp cocktail vaccine" containing a structural protein(s) (Sp) and a 
non-structural protein(s) (Nsp) would stimulate effective complementary immune 
responses.

The pandemic declaration of Covid-19 disease by World Health Organization (WHO) 
and subsequent widespread morbidities and mortalities in almost all countries of 
the world led to the research and development to find out a vaccine against 
SARS-CoV2 virus. Normally any new vaccine development takes 10-15 y time but the 
search for vaccine against SARS-CoV2 is going on at a very fast pace resulting 
in almost breakthrough in vaccine development by several research institutions 
and vaccine manufacturers. In pandemic situation, however, the entire process of 
vaccine development including clinical trials gets shortened and may be fast 
tracked to 15-18 mo time. It is expected that there shall be simultaneous 
marketing of several vaccines by the beginning of 2021. There are more than 164 
candidate vaccines which are in the process of development and among them 24 
vaccines are in advanced stages of development. This review aims at highlighting 
the present stages of development of vaccines and discussing the challenges that 
may be faced with these novel vaccines.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Covid-19 is a global pandemic that requires a global and 
integrated response of all national medical and healthcare systems. Covid-19 
exposed the need for timely response and data sharing on fast spreading global 
pandemics. In this study, we investigate the scientific research response from 
the early stages of the pandemic, and we review key findings on how the early 
warning systems developed in previous epidemics responded to contain the virus.
METHODS: We conducted data mining of scientific literature records from the Web 
of Science Core Collection, using the topics Covid-19, mortality, immunity, and 
vaccine. The individual records are analysed in isolation, and the analysis is 
compared with records on all Covid-19 research topics combined. The data records 
are analysed with commutable statistical methods, including R Studio's 
Bibliometrix package, and the Web of Science data mining tool.
RESULTS: From historical analysis of scientific data records on viruses, 
pandemics and mortality, we identified that Chinese universities have not been 
leading on these topics historically. However, during the early stages of the 
Covid-19 pandemic, the Chinese universities are strongly dominating the research 
on these topics. Despite the current political and trade disputes, we found 
strong collaboration in Covid-19 research between the US and China. From the 
analysis on Covid-19 and immunity, we wanted to identify the relationship 
between different risk factors discussed in the news media. We identified a few 
clusters, containing references to exercise, inflammation, smoking, obesity and 
many additional factors. From the analysis on Covid-19 and vaccine, we 
discovered that although the USA is leading in volume of scientific research on 
Covid-19 vaccine, the leading 3 research institutions (Fudan, Melbourne, Oxford) 
are not based in the USA. Hence, it is difficult to predict which country would 
be first to produce a Covid-19 vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS: We analysed the conceptual structure maps with factorial analysis 
and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), and identified multiple 
relationships between keywords, synonyms and concepts, related to Covid-19 
mortality, immunity, and vaccine development. We present integrated and 
corelated knowledge from 276 records on Covid-19 and mortality, 71 records on 
Covid-19 and immunity, and 189 records on Covid-19 vaccine.

In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the societal 
disruption it has brought, national governments and the international community 
have invested billions of dollars and immense amounts of human resources to 
develop a safe and effective vaccine in an unprecedented time frame. Vaccination 
against this novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2), offers the possibility of significantly reducing severe morbidity 
and mortality and transmission when deployed alongside other public health 
strategies and improved therapies. Health equity is intertwined with the impact 
of COVID-19 and there are certain populations that are at increased risk of 
severe illness or death from COVID-19. In the United States and worldwide, the 
pandemic is having a disproportionate impact on people who are already 
disadvantaged by virtue of their race and ethnicity, age, health status, 
residence, occupation, socioeconomic condition, or other contributing factors. 
Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccine offers an overarching 
framework for vaccine allocation to assist policy makers in the domestic and 
global health communities. Built on widely accepted foundational principles and 
recognizing the distinctive characteristics of COVID-19, this report's 
recommendations address the commitments needed to implement equitable allocation 
policies for COVID-19 vaccine.

The ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as named by the 
World Health Organization has millions of confirmed cases around the world and 
has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The virus was named SARS-CoV-2 in 
February by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. COVID-19 presents as 
fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache and pneumonia. In a small subset of severe 
cases, the disease quickly progresses to respiratory failure and even death. 
Since the 21st century, there have been three major outbreaks caused by human 
coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that broke 
out in 2003, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and the recent 
pandemic of COVID-19. Since 2003, significant progress has been made in the 
study of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV concerning their natural origins, pathogenesis, 
antiviral development and vaccine design. Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are 
closely related, previous findings on SARS-CoV are highly relevant to a better 
understanding as well as diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of 
SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we highlight recent progresses in the field; compare 
the biological characteristics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; summarize the 
urgently-needed diagnostic, treatment, prevention and control options; and 
provide future perspectives for the outcome of the outbreak and research 
questions to be answered, including some of the difficulties in vaccine 
development. Hopefully, our comments and suggestions would prove useful for the 
control of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in China and the world.

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that emerged from Wuhan city of China in late 
December 2019 continue to pose devastating public health and economic challenges 
across the world. Although the community-wide implementation of basic 
non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, such as social distancing, quarantine 
of suspected COVID-19 cases, isolation of confirmed cases, use of face masks in 
public, contact tracing and testing, have been quite effective in curtailing and 
mitigating the burden of the pandemic, it is universally believed that the use 
of a vaccine may be necessary to effectively curtail and eliminating COVID-19 in 
human populations. This study is based on the use of a mathematical model for 
assessing the impact of a hypothetical imperfect anti-COVID-19 vaccine on the 
control of COVID-19 in the United States. An analytical expression for the 
minimum percentage of unvaccinated susceptible individuals needed to be 
vaccinated in order to achieve vaccine-induced community herd immunity is 
derived. The epidemiological consequence of the herd immunity threshold is that 
the disease can be effectively controlled or eliminated if the minimum herd 
immunity threshold is achieved in the community. Simulations of the model, using 
baseline parameter values obtained from fitting the model with COVID-19 
mortality data for the U.S., show that, for an anti-COVID-19 vaccine with an 
assumed protective efficacy of 80%, at least 82% of the susceptible US 
population need to be vaccinated to achieve the herd immunity threshold. The 
prospect of COVID-19 elimination in the US, using the hypothetical vaccine, is 
greatly enhanced if the vaccination program is combined with other 
interventions, such as face mask usage and/or social distancing. Such 
combination of strategies significantly reduces the level of the vaccine-induced 
herd immunity threshold needed to eliminate the pandemic in the US. For 
instance, the herd immunity threshold decreases to 72% if half of the US 
population regularly wears face masks in public (the threshold decreases to 46% 
if everyone wears a face mask).

To many scientists and political authorities, the development of a vaccine 
against Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will be the 
way to restore normality to civil life in this time of a devastating pandemic. 
Expectations for a vaccine are high while the case numbers continue to rise. As 
of mid-August 2020, more than 20 million people have been infected and more than 
760 000 lives have been lost worldwide. The threat of this virus to health, the 
economy and to society is so great that the wish for a fast track vaccine is 
understandable, but how realistic is it? This survey article tries to give an 
overview of vaccine candidates in development, including preclinical and 
clinical testing, and it mentions some of the societal problems of vaccine 
acceptance.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The last two decades have experienced the outbreaks of 
three different coronaviruses in the different parts of the world namely; Severe 
acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory 
syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-2 
(SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to delineate the differences in viral dynamics and 
clinical features between them and tried to focus on every basic details of 
SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) that every health care provider must know.
METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed database up till April 2, 2020 
and retrieved all the articles published on SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV 
that dealt with viral dynamics.
RESULTS: Ample data is available to suggest the differences in etiology, 
transmission cycle, diagnosis, genetics, hosts, reproductive rates, clinical 
features, laboratory diagnosis and radiological features between SARS-CoV-1, 
MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
CONCLUSION: Although SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is more infectious than SARS-CoV-1 
and MERS-CoV, most infections are generally mild and self-limiting. However, 
case-fatality rates are very high in patients with COVID-19 with comorbidities, 
compared to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.

SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Vaccine Development and Production: An Ethical Way 
Forward.

Iserson KV.

The world awaits a SARS-CoV-2 virus (i.e., COVID-19 disease) vaccine to keep the 
populace healthy, fully reopen their economies, and return their social and 
healthcare systems to "normal." Vaccine safety and efficacy requires meticulous 
testing and oversight; this paper describes how despite grandiose public 
statements, the current vaccine development, testing, and production methods may 
prove to be ethically dubious, medically dangerous, and socially volatile. The 
basic moral concern is the potential danger to the health of human test subjects 
and, eventually, many vaccine recipients. This is further complicated by 
economic and political pressures to reduce government oversight on rushed 
vaccine testing and production, nationalistic distribution goals, and failure to 
plan for the widespread immunization needed to produce global herd immunity. As 
this paper asserts, the public must be better informed to assess promises about 
the novel vaccines being produced and to tolerate delays and uncertainty.

The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 disease as a pandemic 
requiring a rapid response. Through online search, direct communication with 
network members and an internal survey, engagements of developing countries' 
vaccine manufacturers' network members in the research and development of 
COVID-19 vaccines and their capacities in the manufacturing, fill-finish and 
distribution of vaccines were assessed. Currently, 19 network members engaged in 
research and development of COVID-19 vaccines, using six principal technology 
platforms. In addition, an internal survey showed that the number of vaccines 
supplied collectively by 37 members, in 2018-19, was about 3.5 billion doses 
annually. Almost a third of network members having vaccines prequalified by the 
World Health Organization comply with international regulations and mechanisms 
to distribute vaccines across borders. The use of existing manufacturing, 
fill-finish and distribution capabilities can support an efficient roll-out of 
vaccines against COVID-19, while maintaining supply security of existing 
vaccines for on-going immunization programmes.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel respiratory illness caused by 
SARS-CoV-2. Viral entry is mediated through viral spike protein and host ACE2 
enzyme interaction. Most cases are mild; severe disease often involves cytokine 
storm and organ failure. Therapeutics including antivirals, immunomodulators, 
and vaccines are in development. To view this SnapShot, open or download the

The first outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei 
Province, China, in late 2019. The subsequent COVID-19 pandemic rapidly affected 
the health and economy of the world. The global approach to the pandemic was to 
isolate populations to reduce the spread of this deadly virus while vaccines 
began to be developed. In March 2020, the first phase I clinical trial of a 
novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine, mRNA-1273, which 
encodes the spike protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2, began in the United States 
(US). The production of mRNA-based vaccines is a promising recent development in 
the production of vaccines. However, there remain significant challenges in the 
development and testing of vaccines as rapidly as possible to control COVID-19, 
which requires international collaboration. This review aims to describe the 
background to the rationale for the development of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 
vaccines and the current status of the mRNA-1273 vaccine.

SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, first emerged in late 2019 in China. 
It has since infected more than 870,000 individuals and caused more than 43,000 
deaths globally. Here, we discuss therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for 
SARS-CoV-2 with a focus on vaccine development and its challenges. Vaccines are 
being rapidly developed but will likely come too late to affect the first wave 
of a potential pandemic. Nevertheless, critical lessons can be learned for the 
development of vaccines against rapidly emerging viruses. Importantly, 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be essential to reducing morbidity and mortality if the 
virus establishes itself in the population.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading globally, and the 
WHO has declared this outbreak a pandemic. Vaccines are an effective way to 
prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, the immune response against 
SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be understood for the development of an efficient 
and safe vaccine. Here, we review the current understanding of vaccine targets 
and the status of vaccine development for COVID-19. We also describe host immune 
responses to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses in terms of innate and 
adaptive immunities.

Introduction: Several vaccine candidates are being clinically tested in response 
to the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This study was conducted to 
assess the acceptance of a 50 or 95% effective COVID-19 vaccine, when it becomes 
available in southeast Asia, among the general population in Indonesia. Methods: 
A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 25 and April 6, 
2020. Participants were asked if they would accept a free vaccine which was 95 
or 50% effective. Using a logistic regression model, we assessed the 
associations between sociodemographic characteristics, exposure to COVID-19 
information, or perceived risk of infection with acceptance of a hypothetical 
COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Among 1,359 respondents, 93.3% of respondents 
(1,268/1,359) would like to be vaccinated for a 95% effective vaccine, but this 
acceptance decreased to 67.0% (911/1,359) for a vaccine with 50% effectiveness. 
For a 95% effective vaccine, being a healthcare worker and having a higher 
perceived risk of COVID-19 infection were associated with higher acceptance, 
adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.01; 95%CI: 1.01, 4.00 and aOR: 2.21; 95%CI: 1.07, 
4.59, respectively; compared to civil servants, being retired was associated 
with less acceptance (aOR: 0.15; 95%CI: 0.04, 0.63). For a 50% effective 
vaccine, being a healthcare worker was also associated with greater acceptance, 
aOR: 1.57; 95%CI: 1.12, 2.20. Conclusion: Acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine was 
highly influenced by the baseline effectiveness of the vaccine. Preparing the 
general population to accept a vaccine with relatively low effectiveness may be 
difficult.

At the time of writing this review, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 
syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 2,355,853 patients and resulted 
in more than 164,656 deaths worldwide (as of 20 April 2020). This review 
highlights the preventive measures, available clinical therapies and the 
potential of vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 by taking into consideration 
the strong genetic similarities of the 2003 epidemic SARS-CoV. Recent studies 
are investigating the repurposing of US FDA-approved drugs as there is no 
available vaccine yet with many attempts under clinical evaluation. Several 
antivirals, antimalarials and immunomodulators that have shown activity against 
SARS-CoV and Middle East coronavirus respiratory syndromes are being evaluated. 
In particular, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, arbidol, tocilizumab 
and bevacizumab have shown promising results. The main aim of this review is to 
provide an overview of this pandemic and where we currently stand.

Vaccines against COVID-19 have the potential to protect people before they are 
exposed to the infective form of the virus. However, because of the involvement 
of pathogenic immune processes in many severe presentations of COVID-19, 
eliciting an immune response with a vaccine must strike a delicate balance to 
achieve viral clearance without also inducing immune-mediated harm. This Outlook 
synthesizes current laboratory findings to define which parts of the immune 
system help with recovery from and protection against the virus and which can 
lead to adverse outcomes. To inform our understanding, we analyze research about 
the immune mechanisms implicated in SARS-CoV, from the 2003 outbreak, and 
SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. The impact of how innate immunity, 
humoral immunity, and cell-mediated immunity play a role in a harmful versus 
helpful response is discussed, establishing principles to guide the development 
and evaluation of a safe but effective COVID-19 vaccine. The principles derived 
include (i) targeting the appropriate specificity and effector function of the 
humoral response, (ii) eliciting a T cell response, especially a cytotoxic T 
cell response, to achieve safe, yet effective, immune protection from COVID-19, 
and (iii) monitoring for the possibility of acute lung injury during SARS-CoV-2 
infection post-vaccination in preclinical and clinical studies. These principles 
can not only guide efforts toward a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, but 
also the development of effective vaccines for viral pandemics to come.

There is a desperate need for effective therapies and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 to 
mitigate the growing economic crisis that has ensued from societal lockdown. 
Vaccines are being developed at an unprecedented speed and are already in 
clinical trials, without preclinical testing for safety and efficacy. Yet, 
safety evaluation of candidate vaccines must not be overlooked.

Here, Iwasaki and Yang highlight the potential dangers of inducing suboptimal 
antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2. They stress the need for proper safety 
evaluation of candidate vaccines for COVID-19.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic first hit Wuhan, China, in December 2019, scientists 
have been racing to develop and test novel vaccines to protect against severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The speed of scientific 
discovery related to COVID-19 is unprecedented. With several vaccine candidates 
already being tested in clinical trials, we pose the question: what will the 
vaccine hesitant do in the face of this pandemic?

A novel coronavirus (CoV), Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2), emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China and has since spread as a 
global pandemic. Safe and effective vaccines are thus urgently needed to reduce 
the significant morbidity and mortality of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
disease and ease the major economic impact. There has been an unprecedented 
rapid response by vaccine developers with now over one hundred vaccine 
candidates in development and at least six having reached clinical trials. 
However, a major challenge during rapid development is to avoid safety issues 
both by thoughtful vaccine design and by thorough evaluation in a timely manner. 
A syndrome of "disease enhancement" has been reported in the past for a few 
viral vaccines where those immunized suffered increased severity or death when 
they later encountered the virus or were found to have an increased frequency of 
infection. Animal models allowed scientists to determine the underlying 
mechanism for the former in the case of Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 
vaccine and have been utilized to design and screen new RSV vaccine candidates. 
Because some Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS-CoV-1 vaccines 
have shown evidence of disease enhancement in some animal models, this is a 
particular concern for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. To address this challenge, the 
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the Brighton 
Collaboration (BC) Safety Platform for Emergency vACcines (SPEAC) convened a 
scientific working meeting on March 12 and 13, 2020 of experts in the field of 
vaccine immunology and coronaviruses to consider what vaccine designs could 
reduce safety concerns and how animal models and immunological assessments in 
early clinical trials can help to assess the risk. This report summarizes the 
evidence presented and provides considerations for safety assessment of COVID-19 
vaccine candidates in accelerated vaccine development.

Interest in COVID-19 vaccine trials participation among young adults in China: 
Willingness, reasons for hesitancy, and demographic and psychosocial 
determinants.

Sun S, Lin D, Operario D.

BACKGROUND: With the demand for rapid COVID-19 vaccine development and 
evaluation, this paper aimed to describe the prevalence and correlates of 
willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials among university students 
in China.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey with 1,912 Chinese university students was 
conducted during March and April 2020. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were 
performed to identify variables associated with willingness to participate.
RESULTS: The majority of participants (64.01%) indicated willingness to 
participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Hesitancy over signing informed consent 
documents, concerns over time necessary for participating in a medical study, 
and perceived COVID-19 societal stigma were identified as deterrents, whereas 
lower socioeconomic status, female gender, perception of likely COVID-19 
infection during the pandemic, and COVID-19 prosocial behaviors were 
facilitative factors. Further, public health mistrust and hesitancy over signing 
informed consent documents had a significant interactive effect on vaccine trial 
willingness.
CONCLUSIONS: High standards of ethical and scientific practice are needed in 
COVID-19 vaccine research, including providing potential participants full and 
accurate information and ensuring participation free of coercion, socioeconomic 
inequality, and stigma. Attending to the needs of marginalized groups and 
addressing psychosocial factors including stigma and public health mistrust may 
also be important to COVID-19 vaccine development and future uptake.

Immediately after declaring COVID-19 as a pandemic, numerous wild conspiracy 
theories sprouted through social media. Pakistan is quite vulnerable to such 
conspiracy narratives and has experienced failures of polio vaccination programs 
because of such claims. Recently, two well-known political figures raised 
conspiracy theories against COVID-19 vaccines in Pakistan, stating that COVID-19 
is a grand illusion and a conspiracy against Muslim countries. This theory is 
much discussed in the local community, supporting COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We 
urge healthcare authorities in Pakistan to take necessary measures against such 
claims before they penetrate to the general community. Anti-vaccine movements 
could undermine efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that ethical 
and responsible behavior of mass media, a careful advisory from the Pakistan 
Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, stern measures from healthcare 
authorities, effective maneuvers to increase public awareness on COVID-19, 
vigorous analysis of information by data or communications scientists, and 
publication of counter opinions from health professionals against such theories 
will go a long way in neutralizing such misleading claims. Because Pakistan is 
experiencing a large burden of disease, with a sharp rise in confirmed cases, 
immediate action is of paramount importance to eradicate any potential barriers 
to a future COVID-19 vaccination program.

The rapid spread of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 greatly threatens global public 
health but no prophylactic vaccine is available. Here, we report the generation 
of a replication-incompetent recombinant serotype 5 adenovirus, Ad5-S-nb2, 
carrying a codon-optimized gene encoding Spike protein (S). In mice and rhesus 
macaques, intramuscular injection with Ad5-S-nb2 elicits systemic S-specific 
antibody and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses. Intranasal inoculation 
elicits both systemic and pulmonary antibody responses but weaker CMI response. 
At 30 days after a single vaccination with Ad5-S-nb2 either intramuscularly or 
intranasally, macaques are protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. A subsequent 
challenge reveals that macaques vaccinated with a 10-fold lower vaccine dosage 
(1 × 1010 viral particles) are also protected, demonstrating the effectiveness 
of Ad5-S-nb2 and the possibility of offering more vaccine dosages within a 
shorter timeframe. Thus, Ad5-S-nb2 is a promising candidate vaccine and warrants 
further clinical evaluation.

INTRODUCTION: The world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic. The development of a 
vaccine is challenging. We aimed to determine the proportion of people who 
intend to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in France or to participate in a 
vaccine clinical trial.
METHODS: We conducted an anonymous on-line survey from the 26th of March to the 
20th of April 2020. Primary endpoints were the intention to get vaccinated 
against COVID-19 if a vaccine was available or participate in a vaccine clinical 
trial.
RESULTS: Three thousand two hundred and fifty nine individuals answered the 
survey; women accounted for 67.4% of the respondents. According to their 
statements, 2.512 participants (77.6%, 95% CI 76.2-79%) will certainly or 
probably agree to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Older age, male gender, fear 
about COVID-19, being a healthcare worker and individual perceived risk were 
associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Vaccine hesitancy was associated 
with a decrease in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. One thousand and five hundred 
and fifty respondents (47.6% 95% CI 45.9-49.3%) will certainly or probably agree 
to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. Older age, male gender, 
being a healthcare worker and individual perceived risk were associated with 
potential acceptance to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. 
Vaccine hesitancy was associated with refusal for participation in a COVID-19 
vaccine clinical trial.
CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 75% and 48% of the survey respondents were respectively 
likely to accept vaccination or participation in a clinical trial against 
COVID-19. Vaccine hesitancy will be the major barrier to COVID-19 vaccine 
uptake.

The achievements of vaccine research and development bring a hope to our 
societies that we may cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. There are two aspects 
that should be maintained in balance: the immediate necessity for speed of 
vaccine research and the inherent need for protection of research subjects, 
which is the foremost concern of research ethics. This narrative review 
highlights ethical issues in COVID-19 vaccine research and development that 
every stakeholder needs to be aware of and to consider.

Calmette-Guérin is one of the most commonly delivered therapies in urology, in 
this editorial we discuss some points that we think will be of interest and 
guidance to practicing urologists during this public health emergency.

How countries, particularly low- and middle-income economies, should pay the 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is an important and understudied 
issue. We undertook an online survey to measure the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for 
a COVID-19 vaccine and its determinants in Indonesia. The WTP was assessed using 
a simple dichotomous contingent valuation approach and a linear regression model 
was used to assess its associated determinants. There were 1,359 respondents who 
completed the survey. In total, 78.3% (1,065) were willing to pay for the 
COVID-19 vaccine with a mean and median WTP of US$ 57.20 (95%CI: US$ 54.56, US$ 
59.85) and US$ 30.94 (95%CI: US$ 30.94, US$ 30.94), respectively. Being a 
health-care worker, having a high income, and having high perceived risk were 
associated with higher WTP. These findings suggest that the WTP for a COVID-19 
vaccine is relatively high in Indonesia. This WTP information can be used to 
construct a payment model for a COVID-19 vaccine in the country. Nevertheless, 
to attain higher vaccine coverage, it may be necessary to partially subsidize 
the vaccine for those who are less wealthy and to design health promotion 
materials to increase the perceived risk for COVID-19 in the country.

Achieving high levels of neutralizing antibodies to the spike protein of 
SARS-CoV-2 in a safe manner is likely to be crucial for an effective vaccine. 
Here, we propose that aluminium-based adjuvants might hold the key to this.

An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or 2019-CoV) infection has posed 
significant threats to international health and the economy. In the absence of 
treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to 
control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all 
treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus 
infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific 
treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We 
suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated 
before the administration of general treatments and the current children's 
RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for 
uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma 
should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we 
suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the 
emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable.

In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, a novel 
coronavirus, initiated an outbreak of pneumonia from Wuhan in China, which 
rapidly spread worldwide. The clinical characteristics of the disease range from 
asymptomatic cases or mild symptoms, which include nonspecific symptoms such as 
fever, cough, sore throat, headache, and nasal congestion to severe cases such 
as pneumonia, respiratory failure demanding mechanical ventilation to 
multi-organ failure, sepsis, and death. As the transmission rate is quite 
alarming, we require an effective therapeutic strategy to treat symptomatic 
patients and adopt the preventive measures in order to contain the infection and 
prevent community transmission. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is 
a public health emergency of international concern, hence repurposing of the 
drugs is an attractive and a feasible option because PK/PD profile, toxicity 
profile, and drug interactions are already known. This review emphasizes on the 
different aspects of COVID-19 such as the epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, 
diagnosis, and preventive measures to be adopted in order to fight this 
pandemic. It also highlights upon the ethics preparedness and challenges faced 
by a developing country like India during such an outbreak. The review focuses 
on the various approaches adopted till date for developing effective therapeutic 
strategies including combination of drugs, vaccine therapy, and convalescent 
plasma therapy to combat this viral outbreak.

The ongoing enigmatic COVID-19 outbreak, first reported from Wuhan, China, on 
last day of the year 2019, which has spread to 213 countries, territories/areas 
till 28th April 2020, threatens hundreds of thousands human souls. This 
devastating viral infection has stimulated the urgent development of viable 
vaccine against COVID-19 across the research institutes around the globe. The 
World Health Organization (WHO) has also confirmed that the recent pandemic is 
causing Public Health Emergency of International apprehension. Moreover, the 
earlier two pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and many others yet to be 
identified pose a universal menace. Here, in this piece of work, we have 
utilized an in silico structural biology and advanced immunoinformatic 
strategies to devise a multi-epitope subunit vaccine against ongoing COVID-19 
infection. The engineered vaccine sequence is adjuvanted with ß-3 defensin and 
comprised of B-cell epitopes, HTL epitopes and CTL epitopes. This is very likely 
that the vaccine will be able to elicit the strong immune response. Further, 
specific binding of the engineered vaccine and immune cell receptor TLR3 was 
estimated by molecular interaction studies. Strong interaction in the binding 
groove as well as good docking scores affirmed the stringency of engineered 
vaccine. The interaction is stable with minimal deviation in root-mean square 
deviation and root-mean-square fluctuation was confirmed by the molecular 
dynamics simulation experiment. The immune-simulation by C-ImmSim server, which 
mimics the natural immune environment, yielded more potent immune response data 
of B-cells, Th cells, Tc cells and IgG for vaccine. The encouraging data 
obtained from the various in-silico works indicated this vaccine as an effective 
therapeutic against COVID-19.

COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease that has turned into a pandemic. It 
spreads through droplet transmission of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It is an 
RNA virus displaying a spike protein as the major surface protein with 
significant sequence similarity to SARS-CoV which causes severe acute 
respiratory syndrome. The receptor binding domain of the spike protein interacts 
with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and is considered as the 
antigenic determinant for stimulating an immune response. While multiple 
candidate vaccines are currently under different stages of development, there 
are no known therapeutic interventions at the moment. This review describes the 
key genetic features that are being considered for generating vaccine candidates 
by employing innovative technologies. It also highlights the global efforts 
being undertaken to deliver vaccines for COVID-19 through unprecedented 
international cooperation and future challenges post development.

Herd immunity is a key concept for epidemic control. It states that only a 
proportion of a population needs to be immune (through overcoming natural 
infection or through vaccination) to an infectious agent for it to stop 
generating large outbreaks. A key question in the current COVID-19 pandemic is 
how and when herd immunity can be achieved and at what cost.

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the concept of herd immunity has become a 
topic of much debate. This Comment examines the factors that determine it, 
discusses how far we have come and considers what it will take to reach herd 
immunity safely.

The impact of COVID-19 is changing with country wise and depend on universal 
immunization policies. COVID-19 badly affects countries that did not have 
universal immunization policies or having them only for the selective population 
of countries (highly prominent population) like Italy, USA, UK, Netherland, etc. 
Universal immunization of BCG can provide great protection against the COVID-19 
infection because the BCG vaccine gives broad protection against respiratory 
infections. BCG vaccine induces expressions of the gene that are involved in the 
antiviral innate immune response against viral infections with long-term 
maintenance of BCG vaccine-induced cellular immunity. COVID-19 cases are 
reported very much less in the countries with universal BCG vaccination policies 
such as India, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Israel, Japan, etc. as 
compared to without BCG implemented countries such as the USA, Italy, Spain, 
Canada, UK, etc. BCG vaccine provides protection for 50-60 years of 
immunization, so the elderly population needs to be revaccinated with BCG. 
Several countries started clinical trials of the BCG vaccine for health care 
workers and elderly people. BCG can be uses as a prophylactic treatment until 
the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine.

SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, has become a major public health 
issue. The severe morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 necessitate 
the development of effective vaccines to prevent epidemics. There is an 
unprecedented need to produce and distribute enough safe and effective vaccines 
to individuals globally. Here, we discuss the challenges in several aspects 
including the vaccine safety, vaccine efficacy, human challenge trials and 
production capacity in COVID-19 vaccine development.

Researchers have been working quickly and collaboratively for the development of 
vaccines against the COVID-19 virus. The effort of the scientific community in 
searching a vaccine for COVID-19 may be hampered by a diffused vaccine 
hesitancy. Two waves of data collection on representative samples of the Italian 
population (during the "first" and "second" phase of the Italian Covid-19 
mitigation strategy) were conducted to understand citizens' perceptions and 
behaviors about preventive behaviors willingness to vaccine for COVID-19. Our 
study shows that willingness to COVID-19 vaccine is correlated to trust in 
research and in vaccines, which decreased between phase 1 and phase 2 of the 
Italian pandemic. According to the results of our study, the proportion of 
citizens that seem to be intentioned to get the Covid-19 vaccine is probably too 
small to effectively stop the spreading of the disease. This requires to foster 
a climate of respectful mutual trust between science and society, where 
scientific knowledge is not only preached but also cultivated and sustained 
thanks to the emphatic understanding of citizens worries, needs of reassurance 
and health expectations.

It is often said that it takes 17 years to move medical research from bench to 
bedside. In a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) world, such time-lags feel 
intolerable. In these extraordinary circumstances could years be made into 
months? If so, could those lessons be used to accelerate medical research when 
the crisis eases?To measure time-lags in health and biomedical research as well 
as to identify ways of reducing them, we developed and published (in 2015) a 
matrix consisting of overlapping tracks (or stages/phases) in the translation 
from discovery research to developed products, policies and practice. The matrix 
aids analysis by highlighting the time and actions required to develop research 
(and its translation) both (1) along each track and (2) from one track to 
another, e.g. from the discovery track to the research-in-humans track. We noted 
four main approaches to reducing time-lags, namely increasing resources, working 
in parallel, starting or working at risk, and improving processes.Examining 
these approaches alongside the matrix helps interpret the enormous global effort 
to develop a vaccine for the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative 
agent of COVID-19. Rapid progress in the discovery/basic and human research 
tracks is being made through a combination of large-scale funding, work being 
conducted in parallel (between different teams globally and through working in 
overlapping tracks), working at greater (but proportionate) risk to safety than 
usual, and adopting various new processes. The overlapping work of some of the 
teams involves continuing animal research whilst entering vaccine candidates 
into Phase I trials alongside planning their Phase II trials. The additional 
funding available helps to reduce some of the usual financial risks in moving so 
quickly. Going forward through the increasingly large human trials for safety, 
dosage and efficacy, it will be vital to overlap work in parallel in the often 
challenging public policy and clinical tracks. Thus, regulatory and 
reimbursement bodies are beginning and preparing rapid action to pull vaccines 
proving to be safe and effective through to extraordinarily rapid application to 
the general population. Monitoring the development of a COVID-19 vaccine using 
the matrix (modified as necessary) could help identify which of the approaches 
speeding development and deployment could be usefully applied more widely in the 
future.

Plain Language Summary: The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has created a global 
humanitarian and economic crisis for which there is currently no solution in 
sight. Much hope has therefore been pinned on a vaccine that can protect against 
the disease COVID-19. As of August 2020, the World Health Organization has 
registered 173 vaccine candidates as being in development. Six candidates have 
entered phase 3 trials, and the first results from these are expected in the 
autumn.

The debate around vaccines has been in the spotlight over the last few years in 
Europe, both within the scientific community and the general public debate. In 
this regard, the case of the Italian vaccination debate is particularly worrying 
given that Italy has been one of the European countries with the highest number 
of measles cases in the recent past. According to this scenario, we conducted a 
cross-sectional study on a convenience sample of Italian university students 
aimed at: (1) exploring their attitudes towards a future vaccine to prevent 
COVID-19 and; (2) evaluating the impact of the university curricula (healthcare 
vs. non-healthcare curricula) on the intention to vaccinate. Descriptive 
analysis on the 735 students that answered to the question on the intention to 
vaccinate showed that 633 (86.1%) students reported that they would choose to 
have a vaccination for the COVID-19 coronavirus; on the other side, 102 (13.9%) 
students reported that they would not or be not sure to vaccine (low intention 
to vaccinate). This means that in our sample more than one student out of 10 
shows low intention to vaccinate (vaccine hesitancy). Furthermore, when running 
analysis comparing healthcare students versus non-healthcare students we found 
no significant differences in responses' percentage distribution (p = .097). 
Understanding the student's perspective about the future COVID-19 vaccine and 
supporting their health engagement and consciousness may be useful in planning 
adequate response and multidisciplinary educational strategies-including the 
psychological perspective on vaccine hesitancy underlying factors - in the 
post-pandemic period.

INTRODUCTION: Vaccine hesitancy is a chronic public health threat. This study 
was carried out to ascertain Maltese healthcare workers' hesitancy to a novel 
COVID-19 vaccine and correlate this with influenza vaccine uptake.
METHODS: A short, anonymous questionnaire was sent out to all of Malta's 
government sector healthcare workers via the service's standard email services 
(11-19/09/2020). A total of 9681 questionnaires were posted electronically, with 
10.4% response.
RESULTS: The proportion of Maltese healthcare workers who will take the 
influenza vaccine increased significantly. Doctors had the highest baseline 
uptake and highest likely influenza vaccine uptake next winter. The 
likely/undecided/unlikely to take a COVID-19 vaccine were 52/22/26% 
respectively. Males were likelier to take the vaccine. Doctors were the 
occupation with the highest projected vaccine uptake. Likelihood of taking 
COVID-19 vaccine was directly related to the likelihood of influenza 
vaccination. Concerns raised were related to insufficient knowledge about such a 
novel vaccine, especially unknown long term side effects.
DISCUSSION: The increased uptake of influenza vaccine is probably due to 
increased awareness of respiratory viral illness. Doctors may have higher 
vaccine uptakes due to greater awareness and knowledge of vaccine safety. The 
proportions of who are likely/undecided/unlikely (half, quarter, quarter 
respectively) to take a COVID-19 are similar to rates reported in other 
countries. The higher male inclination to take the vaccine may be due the innate 
male propensity for perceived risk taking. Shared COVID-19 with influenza 
vaccine hesitancy implies an innate degree of vaccine reluctance/hesitancy and 
not merely reluctance based on novel vaccine knowledge gap.

The 2013-2016 West Africa EBOV epidemic was the biggest EBOV outbreak to date. 
An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 
26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV protein. The 
dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein 
(NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important 
part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire. We show that a 9-amino-acid 
peptide NP44-52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a conserved region of EBOV NP provides 
protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge. A 
single vaccination in a C57BL/6 mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide 
vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our 
work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8+ T-cell immunity in EBOV 
survivors is conceptually sound and feasible. Nucleocapsid proteins within 
SARS-CoV-2 contain multiple Class I epitopes with predicted HLA restrictions 
consistent with broad population coverage. A similar approach to a CTL vaccine 
design may be possible for that virus.

The global threat of COVID-19 is continued with no commercially available 
vaccine or drug yet. While the application of convalescent therapy is usually 
beneficial, for critically ill patients, the detrimental effect associated with 
some antibodies is also reported. The immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody in 
response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
infection is described, albeit the lack of defining whether the difference in 
subclasses has a beneficial or detrimental role. IgG2 has limited ability to 
activate innate immune cells and complement-mediated inflammation, which have 
been inversely described in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. The expansion of IgG2 is 
promoted by interferon γ (IFN-γ); however, there is a low level of IFN-γ in 
COVID-19 patients. Therefore, this review describes the importance of targeting 
IgG2, with IFN-γ in minimizing the SARS-CoV-2 associated inflammation, and may 
provide insight into the design of vaccine or antibody-based therapies to 
COVID-19 disease.

In response to provocative comments by 2 European clinicians and scientists, the 
World Health Organization Director General has declared that Africa will not 
host COVID-19 vaccine trials. Such a stance risks stigmatizing COVID-19 vaccine 
trials in Africa and depriving Africa of critical research. To the contrary, 
there is a critical need for Africa to host COVID-19 vaccine trials on public 
health, scientific, and ethics grounds.

SARS-CoV-2, a newly emerged pathogen in December 2019, marked as one of the 
highly pathogenic Coronavirus, and altogether this is the third coronavirus 
attack that crossed the species barrier. As of 1st July 2020, it is spreading 
around 216 countries, areas or territories, and a total of 10,185,374 and 
503,862 confirmed cases and death reports, respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 virus 
entered into the target cells by binding with the hACE2 receptors. Spike 
glycoprotein promotes the entry of the virus into host target cells. Literature 
reported a significant mutation in receptor binding sites and membrane proteins 
of the previous SARS-CoV to turned as SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for most 
dreadful pandemic COVID-19. These modifications may be the probable reason for 
the extreme transmission and pathogenicity of the virus. A hasty spread of 
COVID-19 throughout the world is highly threatening, but still, scientists do 
not have a proper therapeutic measure to fight with it. Scientists are 
endeavoring across the world to find effective therapy to combat COVID 19. 
Several drugs such as Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Chloroquine, Ribavirin, 
Ritonavir, Lopinavir, Favipiravir, Interferons, Bevacizumab, Azithromycin, etc. 
are currently under clinical trials. Vaccine development from various 
pharmaceutical companies and research institutes is under progress, and more 
than ten vaccine candidates are in the various phases of clinical trials. This 
review work highlighted the origin, emergence, structural features, 
pathogenesis, and clinical features of COVID-19. We have also discussed the 
in-line treatment strategies, preventive measures, and vaccines to combat the 
emergence of COVID-19.

coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Within a short span, COVID-19 was 
declared a global public health emergency affecting 214 countries with 5,939,234 
confirmed cases and 3,67,255 deaths as of 30 May 2020. With limited knowledge 
about SARS-CoV-2, no approved treatment or vaccine is available till date.
AREAS COVERED: We performed a review of literature on PubMed on the SARS-CoV-2 
virus and COVID-19 illness including trials of preventive and therapeutic 
measures. This review presents the basic biology of coronaviruses, epidemiology 
of COVID-19, clinical presentations, investigational therapies and vaccines, 
infection prevention and control measures and the lessons from the present 
pandemic.
EXPERT OPINION: The scale of the outbreak has brought the governments, 
health-care professionals, and scientists around the world under tremendous 
pressure to devise control strategies and develop novel prevention measures. 
While availability of vaccine for COVID-19 may take time, the disease may be 
contained through hand hygiene, physical distancing, travel restriction, and 
aggressive steps such as 'lockdown.' Clinical trials at different phases are 
ongoing across different countries to expedite the development of effective 
drugs and vaccine to overcome the pandemic.

A novel coronavirus, designated as SARS-CoV-2, first emerged in Wuhan City, 
Hubei Province, China, in late December 2019. The rapidly increasing number of 
cases has caused worldwide panic. In this review, we describe some currently 
applied diagnostic approaches, as well as therapeutics and vaccines, to prevent, 
treat and control further outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

A vaccine to protect against COVID-19 is urgently needed. Such a vaccine should 
efficiently induce high-affinity neutralizing antibodies which neutralize 
SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19. However, there is a concern regarding both 
vaccine-induced eosinophilic lung disease and eosinophil-associated Th2 
immunopotentiation following infection after vaccination. Here, we review the 
anticipated characteristics of a COVID-19 vaccine to avoid vaccine-associated 
eosinophil immunopathology.

PURPOSE: COVID-19 as a pandemic calls for rapid development of vaccines.
METHODS: Here a proposal of a seamless, adaptive, phase 1-3 trial for 
accelerated vaccine development is described.
RESULTS: Starting at 10, the number of vaccinated volunteers would exponentially 
increase by tenfold at an interval of 2 weeks; close surveillance of antibody 
responses, safety and efficacy is necessary. After only 16 weeks, general 
vaccination would be feasible if supply meets the demand.
CONCLUSION: A COVID-19 vaccine would be rapidly available at a slightly 
increased risk for undetected late side effects or insufficient efficacy if 
compared with standard vaccine development schemes.

Since the first World Health Organization notification on 31 December 2019, 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory disease caused by the 
coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has 
been responsible for over four million confirmed infections and almost 300 000 
deaths worldwide. The pandemic has led to over half of the world's population 
living under lockdown conditions. To allow normal life to resume, public health 
interventions will be needed to prevent further waves of infections as lockdown 
measures are lifted. As one of the most effective countermeasures against 
infectious diseases, an efficacious vaccine is considered crucial to containing 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the publication of the genome sequence of 
SARS-CoV-2, vaccine development has accelerated at an unprecedented pace across 
the world. Here we review the different platforms employed to develop vaccines, 
the standard timelines of development and how they can be condensed in a 
pandemic situation. We focus on vaccine development in the UK and vaccines that 
have entered clinical trials around the world.

COVID-19 pandemic predictions using the modified Bateman SIZ model and 
observational data for Heidelberg, Germany: Effect of vaccination with a 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, coronavirus testing and application of the Corona-Warn-App.

Braun P, Haffner S, Woodcock BG.

AIMS OF THE STUDY: Published data show that the current progression of the 
COVID-19 pandemic in Heidelberg, Germany, despite the current lockdown, could 
continue into 2021 and become more severe. We have used the modified Bateman SIZ 
algorithm to predict the effects of interventional measures to control the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Model parameters, e.g., doubling time and rate of 
decrease in the number of infectious persons were obtained from published 
reports. Predictions were made for the status quo on June 1, 2020, and for 
interventional measures obtained for 4 scenarios. These included vaccination of 
the whole population using a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine having an efficacy of 50% and 
100%, mass-testing for COVID-19 coronavirus and application of the 
Corona-Warn-App.
RESULTS: The principle findings were 1) without new measures to control the 
pandemic, the daily number of infectious persons could reach a peak of > 4,500 
daily within 18 months when > 67,000 persons would have been infected. This 
could be prevented by using a vaccine with 50% efficacy which was almost equally 
effective as a vaccine with 100% efficacy. Application of the Corona-Warn-App 
was the most effective method and more effective than testing for COVID-19. The 
methodology used has been described in detail to enable other researchers to 
apply the modified Bateman SIZ model to obtain predictions for COVID-19 
outbreaks in other regions. Application of the model has been verified by 
independent investigators using different commercial software packages.
CONCLUSION: The modified Bateman SIZ model has been verified and used to predict 
the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Heidelberg. Lockdown measures alone are 
insufficient to control the pandemic during 2021. Vaccination, diagnostic tests, 
and use of the Corona-Warn-App with quarantine could successfully control the 
spread of the coronavirus infection in the community. The Corona-Warn-App 
applied correctly may be the most effective. The model showed that vaccination 
with 50% efficacy is almost as effective as vaccination with 100% efficacy.

The 2019-novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 is 
transmitted from human to human has recently reported in China. Now COVID-19 has 
been spread all over the world and declared epidemics by WHO. It has caused a 
Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The elderly and people with 
underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, 
which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 
cytokine storm. Due to the rapid increase of SARS-CoV-2 infections and 
unavailability of antiviral therapeutic agents, developing an effective 
SAR-CoV-2 vaccine is urgently required. SARS-CoV-2 which is genetically similar 
to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an 
enveloped, single and positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome comprising 
29,891 nucleotides, which encode the 12 putative open reading frames responsible 
for the synthesis of viral structural and nonstructural proteins which are very 
similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV proteins. In this review we have summarized 
various vaccine candidates i.e., nucleotide, subunit and vector based as well as 
attenuated and inactivated forms, which have already been demonstrated their 
prophylactic efficacy against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, so these candidates could 
be used as a potential tool for the development of a safe and effective vaccine 
against SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel beta-coronavirus causing over 200.000 lethal cases within 
six months of first infecting humans. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, a form of 
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). COVID-19 is characterized by two 
phases: the first resembles the flu with pneumonia, but after about seven or 
eight days the disease suddenly worsens to a sepsis-like syndrome. It is 
difficult to explain this virus-immune-pathology sequence from virology or 
immunology only. This paper hypothesizes that host-produced anti-spike protein 
antibodies are responsible for immune-induced viral dissemination. Subsequently, 
systemic distribution of virus-antibodies complexes activates the immune 
pathology observed in severe COVID-19. This hypothesis may be counterintuitive 
to immunologist that consider many anti-spike antibodies to be 
virus-neutralizing antibodies. Although anti-spike antibodies may hinder 
infection of epithelial cells, antibody binding to the spike protein may 
facilitate virus infection of myeloid leukocytes. If myeloid leukocytes reenter 
the circulation, they could spread the virus from a locoregional infection to a 
systemic disease. Disseminated virus in combination with antibodies results in 
dispersed virus-antibody complexes that overstimulate the immune system. The 
hypothesis aligns with the sequences of virus, immune and pathological events in 
COVID-19. The delay in onset from both syndromes results from an immune system 
still naïve to the non-cross-reactive spike protein. Details of this hypothesis 
are in concordance with many clinical characteristics of COVID-19, including its 
predominant lethality for the elderly, and the mostly asymptomatic course of 
disease in children. It predicts putative detrimental effects of vaccines that 
induce virus-neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein, as has been 
shown for other coronaviruses. This hypothesis has consequences for treatment of 
patients, evaluation of personal and herd immunity and vaccine development. In 
patients, cellular immunity should be stimulated. Neutralizing antibodies might 
not be indicative for immunity. Vaccines should aim to stimulate cellular 
immunity COVID-19 and/or stimulate humoral immunity against viral proteins 
except for the immunodominant spike protein.

SARS-CoV-2 is a SARS-like coronavirus of likely zoonotic origin first identified 
in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province. The virus has 
since spread globally, resulting in the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The 
first whole genome sequence was published on January 5 2020, and thousands of 
genomes have been sequenced since this date. This resource allows unprecedented 
insights into the past demography of SARS-CoV-2 but also monitoring of how the 
virus is adapting to its novel human host, providing information to direct drug 
and vaccine design. We curated a dataset of 7666 public genome assemblies and 
analysed the emergence of genomic diversity over time. Our results are in line 
with previous estimates and point to all sequences sharing a common ancestor 
towards the end of 2019, supporting this as the period when SARS-CoV-2 jumped 
into its human host. Due to extensive transmission, the genetic diversity of the 
virus in several countries recapitulates a large fraction of its worldwide 
genetic diversity. We identify regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that have 
remained largely invariant to date, and others that have already accumulated 
diversity. By focusing on mutations which have emerged independently multiple 
times (homoplasies), we identify 198 filtered recurrent mutations in the 
SARS-CoV-2 genome. Nearly 80% of the recurrent mutations produced non-synonymous 
changes at the protein level, suggesting possible ongoing adaptation of 
SARS-CoV-2. Three sites in Orf1ab in the regions encoding Nsp6, Nsp11, Nsp13, 
and one in the Spike protein are characterised by a particularly large number of 
recurrent mutations (>15 events) which may signpost convergent evolution and are 
of particular interest in the context of adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the human 
host. We additionally provide an interactive user-friendly web-application to 
query the alignment of the 7666 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has turned into a global human tragedy 
and economic devastation. Governments have implemented lockdown measures, 
blocked international travel, and enforced other public containment measures to 
mitigate the virus morbidity and mortality. As of today, no drug has the power 
to fight the infection and bring normalcy to the utter chaos. This leaves us 
with only one choice namely an effective and safe vaccine that shall be 
manufactured as soon as possible and available to all countries and populations 
affected by the pandemic at an affordable price. There has been an unprecedented 
fast track path taken in Research & Development by the World community for 
developing an effective and safe vaccine. Platform technology has been exploited 
to develop candidate vaccines in a matter of days to weeks, and as of now, 108 
such vaccines are available. Six of these vaccines have entered clinical trials. 
As clinical trials are "rate-limiting" and "time-consuming", many innovative 
methods are in practice for a fast track. These include parallel phase I-II 
trials and obtaining efficacy data from phase IIb trials. Human "challenge 
experiments" to confirm efficacy in humans is under serious consideration. The 
availability of the COVID-19 vaccine has become a race against time in the 
middle of death and devastation. There is an atmosphere of tremendous hype 
around the COVID-19 vaccine, and developers are using every moment to make 
claims, which remain unverified. However, concerns are raised about a rush to 
deploy a COVID-19 vaccine. Applying "Quick fix" and "short cuts" can lead to 
errors with disastrous consequences.

COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, and an effective vaccine is needed. 
During the outbreak, the urgency for developing candidate vaccines has brought 
distinct challenges to clinical development. An efficacy trial, which measures 
whether the vaccine reduces the incidence of disease, is ordinarily required to 
fully evaluate vaccine efficacy. However, emergency use may be possible if 
promising immunogenicity results are observed. A ring vaccination trial, which 
recruits subjects connected to a known case either socially or geographically, 
is a solution to evaluate vaccine efficacy and control the spread of the disease 
simultaneously although its conduct is challenging. Nevertheless, when COVID-19 
becomes a recurrent epidemic, an 'individual-level' efficacy trial is preferred. 
Innovative statistical designs, including seamless design, platform trial, 
master protocol design, are helpful to accelerate clinical development. A 
seamless Phase I/II design has been applied in multiple COVID-19 vaccine studies 
to date. However, Phase II/III design should be done very carefully. The control 
of type I error, maintaining trial blinding and statistical methods leading to 
unbiased estimates should be pre-specified in the clinical protocol. A Data 
Safety Monitoring Board is especially important, given the need to assure an 
adequate level of safety when society want a safe and effective vaccine.

The urgent drive for vaccine development in the midst of the current COVID-19 
pandemic has prompted public and private organisations to invest heavily in 
research and development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Organisations globally have 
affirmed the commitment of fair global access, but the means by which a 
successful vaccine can be mass produced and equitably distributed remains 
notably unanswered. Barriers for low-income countries include the inability to 
afford vaccines as well as inadequate resources to vaccinate, barriers that are 
exacerbated during a pandemic. Fair distribution of a pandemic vaccine is 
unlikely without a solid ethical framework for allocation. This piece analyses 
four allocation paradigms: ability to develop or purchase; reciprocity; ability 
to implement; and distributive justice, and synthesises their ethical 
considerations to develop an allocation model to fit the COVID-19 pandemic.

BACKGROUND: The availability of a COVID-19 vaccine is being heralded as the 
solution to control the current COVID-19 pandemic, reduce the number of 
infections and deaths and facilitate resumption of our previous way of life.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to provide a framework for primary care of 
what will be needed to optimise COVID-19 vaccine confidence and uptake in 
Australia once the vaccine prioritisation schedule and key target groups are 
known.
DISCUSSION: While a number of vaccines are currently under development, with at 
least seven undergoing phase III trials (28 August 2020), it is hoped that an 
effective COVID-19 vaccine will become available to the public in 2021. Ensuring 
public confidence in vaccine safety and effectiveness will be crucial to 
facilitate uptake. General practitioners are at the forefront of public health, 
and one of the most trusted sources for patients. In this article, the authors 
discuss the expedited vaccine development process for COVID-19 vaccines; the 
likely vaccine prioritisation schedule and anticipated key target groups; the 
behavioural and social drivers of vaccination acceptance, including the work 
required to facilitate this; and the implications for general practice.

Evolution of the current infrastructure for surveillance of vaccine safety will 
be essential to meet our commitments to the public in the deployment of a 
vaccine (or vaccines) to COVID-19. The incorporation of concepts and tools 
within the fields of data science and systems immunology can be used to propel 
vaccine safety monitoring into the twenty-first century.

Rebecca Chandler from the Uppsala Monitoring Centre discusses how the COVID-19 
pandemic could be the catalyst that propels vaccine safety surveillance into the 
twenty-first century.

Coronavirus disease 2019, also known as COVID-19, is caused by a novel 
coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or 
SARS-CoV-2. The infection has now catapulted into a full-blown pandemic across 
the world, which has affected more than 2 million people and has led to 
approximately 150,000 fatalities all over the world (WHO). In this review, we 
elaborate all currently available data that shed light on possible methods for 
treatment of COVID-19, such as antiviral drugs, corticosteroids, convalescent 
plasma, and potentially effective vaccines. Additionally, ongoing and 
discontinued clinical trials that have been carried out for validating probable 
treatments for COVID-19 are discussed. The review also elaborates the 
prospective approach and the possible advantages of using convalescent plasma 
and stem cells for the improvement of clinical symptoms and meeting the demand 
for an instantaneous cure.

BACKGROUND: The development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection is on the 
way. To prepare for public availability, the acceptability of a hypothetical 
COVID-19 vaccine and willingness to pay (WTP) were assessed to provide insights 
into future demand forecasts and pricing considerations.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 3 to 12 April 2020. The 
health belief model (HBM) was used to assess predictors of the intent to receive 
the vaccine and the WTP.
RESULTS: A total of 1,159 complete responses was received. The majority reported 
a definite intent to receive the vaccine (48.2%), followed by a probable intent 
(29.8%) and a possible intent (16.3%). Both items under the perceived benefits 
construct in the HBM, namely believe the vaccination decreases the chance of 
infection (OR = 2.51, 95% CI 1.19-5.26) and the vaccination makes them feel less 
worry (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.03-4.65), were found to have the highest significant 
odds of a definite intention to take the vaccine. The mean ± standard deviation 
(SD) for the amount that participants were willing to pay for a dose of COVID-19 
vaccine was MYR$134.0 (SD±79.2) [US$30.66 ± 18.12]. Most of the participants 
were willing to pay an amount of MYR$100 [US$23] (28.9%) and MYR$50 [US$11.5] 
(27.2%) for the vaccine. The higher marginal WTP for the vaccine was influenced 
by no affordability barriers as well as by socio-economic factors, such as 
higher education levels, professional and managerial occupations and higher 
incomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate the utility of HBM constructs in 
understanding COVID-19 vaccination intention and WTP.

This article discusses the background to the current COVID-19 pandemic. The 
specific features of the causative pathogen (SARS-CoV-2) are outlined, together 
with a 'whistlestop' revision of immunological principles. The article goes on 
to discuss the principles and mechanisms of immunisation and the stages of 
vaccine development. The current situation in relation to the race to develop a 
vaccine against COVID-19 is incorporated and the immunological principles being 
adapted by the top contenders are outlined. These include new approaches based 
on genetic sequencing. Finally, the importance of understanding theoretical 
principles and the potential practical implications for nurses who will be at 
the coalface, reassuring patients and delivering vaccines, is addressed.

The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) poses 
a threat to global health owing to its high rate of spread and severe forms of 
respiratory infection. The lack of vaccines and antivirals prevents clinical 
strategies against the disease, creating an emerging need for the development of 
safe and effective treatments. Strategies for vaccine development include 
complete vaccines against viruses, subunits, and nucleic acids, but are still in 
their early stages. Studies carried out to date on possible SARS-CoV2 drug 
targets highlight glycoprotein S, Mpro (main protease or protease type 3C), and 
a member of the transmembrane serine protease II families (TMPRSS2). However, 
due to the pandemic state, priority is given to marketed drugs. These include 
chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), nitazoxanide, remdesivir, 
Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV / r), in addition to treatment with convalescent 
plasma. But, therapeutic specific effects against SARS-CoV2 have not yet been 
verified. Most of the information obtained about treatment is based on 
preliminary and limited studies. We conclude that, at this time of emergency, 
the search for new therapies is more urgent due to the need to save lives. Thus, 
we point out as interesting targets for future more specific research: 
glycoprotein S, Mpro, and TMPRSS2.

PURPOSE: This study determined the predictors of caregivers' willingness to 
accept an accelerated regulatory process for the development of vaccines against 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
METHODS: An international cross-sectional survey was administered to 2557 
caregivers of children in 17 pediatric emergency departments (EDs) across 6 
countries from March 26, 2020, to June 30, 2020. Caregivers were asked to select 
1 of 4 choices with which they most agreed regarding a proposed COVID-19 
vaccine-approval process, in addition to questions regarding demographic 
characteristics, the ED visit, and attitudes about COVID-19. Univariate analyses 
were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test for comparing non-normally 
distributed continuous variables, an independent t test for comparing normally 
distributed continuous variables, and a χ2 or Fisher exact test for categorical 
variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used for determining 
independent factors associated with caregivers' willingness to accept abridged 
development of a COVID-19 vaccine. A P value of <0.05 was considered 
significant.
FINDINGS: Almost half (1101/2557; 43%) of caregivers reported that they were 
willing to accept less rigorous testing and postresearch approval of a new 
COVID-19 vaccine. Independent factors associated with caregivers' willingness to 
accept expedited COVID-19 vaccine research included having children who were up 
to date on the vaccination schedule (odds ratio [OR] = 1.72; 95% CI, 1.29-2.31), 
caregivers' concern about having had COVID-19 themselves at the time of survey 
completion in the ED (OR = 1.1; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16), and caregivers' intent to 
have their children vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine were to become 
available (OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.54-2.21). Compared with fathers, mothers 
completing the survey were less likely to approve of changes in the 
vaccine-development process (OR = 0.641; 95% CI, 0.529-0.775).
IMPLICATIONS: Less than half of caregivers in this worldwide sample were willing 
to accept abbreviated COVID-19 vaccine testing. As a part of an effort to 
increase acceptance and uptake of a new vaccine, especially in order to protect 
children, public health strategies and individual providers should understand 
caregivers' attitudes toward the approval of a vaccine and consult them 
appropriately.

This study examined 100 widely viewed YouTube videos on COVID-19 vaccination. 
Information such as length, format, upload source, content, and cumulative views 
was coded. As of April 6, 2020, the videos were viewed >33 million times. Almost 
75% were uploaded by news sources (garnering >20 million views). While only 16% 
were uploaded by consumers, these videos garnered over 25% of cumulative views 
(n = 8,581,186 views). The majority of videos mentioned the vaccine 
manufacturing process (61.0%) and 45.0% speculated on the amount of time needed 
to have a vaccine ready for use, which most often was thought to be 1-2 years. 
Even once the biological and technical aspects of vaccine development and 
manufacturing are accomplished, the benefits conferred on population health will 
also depend on public willingness to be vaccinated. Ongoing tracking of YouTube 
is needed to identify what is communicated about vaccines for COVID-19. To the 
extent that public health officials learn how to create videos about the safety 
and effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine, which attract viewers, this could help 
increase awareness and interest about vaccination and help individuals make an 
informed decision about vaccine uptake.

The new coronavirus pneumonia, named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization, 
has become a pandemic. It is highly pathogenic and reproduces quickly. There are 
currently no specific drugs to prevent the reproduction and spread of COVID-19. 
Some traditional Chinese medicines, especially the Lung Cleansing and 
Detoxifying Decoction (Qing Fei Pai Du Tang), have shown therapeutic effects on 
mild and ordinary COVID-19 patients. Polysaccharides are important ingredients 
in this decoction. This review summarizes the potential pharmacological 
activities of polysaccharides isolated by hot water extraction from Lung 
Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction, which is consistent with its production 
method, to provide the theoretical basis for ongoing research on its 
application.

Operation Warp Speed and global vaccine research efforts have succeeded in 
rapidly launching three vaccine candidates for coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) into Phase III clinical trials. A recent letter from Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Redfield underscored the 
possibility of "large-scale" distribution of a coronavirus vaccine as early as 
November 1, 2020. However, recent polling reveals that the majority of Americans 
remain skeptical of both the safety and efficacy of a potential Covid-19 
vaccine. Even more troublesome is the fact that a comprehensive, collaborative 
vaccine marketing campaign has not been initiated to educate the U.S. public on 
and encourage widespread Covid-19 vaccination. Accordingly, this article lays 
out a plan of action, utilizing proven immunization marketing strategies and 
novel approaches, that could be used to combat vaccine hesitancy toward 
Covid-19. A vaccine may indeed be our ticket out of this pandemic, but targeted 
marketing is needed to increase public optimism toward that fact.

Given the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to divulge 
all the available technologies with the potential to fight against this virus. 
Plant biotechnology offers potential solutions to this pandemic through the 
development of low-cost vaccines and antibodies useful for therapy, prophylaxis, 
and diagnosis. The technology to produce plant-made biopharmaceuticals is 
already established; two examples of these are: a therapeutic enzyme that has 
entered the market and the influenza vaccines that are currently under clinical 
trials with encouraging results. Thus far, some companies have started 
developing anti-COVID-19 antibodies and vaccines. In particular, plant-made 
antibodies might be timely produced and approved for human use in the short 
term, while the development of vaccines will take longer time (clinical 
evaluations could be concluded by the end of 2021); nonetheless, the candidates 
obtained will be valuable tools for future outbreaks. The key aspects that will 
define the exploitation of this technology in the fight against COVID-19 are 
discussed.

In the current context of the pandemic triggered by SARS-COV-2, the immunization 
of the population through vaccination is recognized as a public health priority. 
In the case of SARS‑COV‑2, the genetic sequencing was done quickly, in one 
month. Since then, worldwide research has focused on obtaining a vaccine. This 
has a major economic impact because new technological platforms and advanced 
genetic engineering procedures are required to obtain a COVID‑19 vaccine. The 
most difficult scientific challenge for this future vaccine obtained in the 
laboratory is the proof of clinical safety and efficacy. The biggest challenge 
of manufacturing is the construction and validation of production platforms 
capable of making the vaccine on a large scale.

On the 30th of January 2020, the World Health Organization fired up the sirens 
against a fast spreading infectious disease caused by a newly discovered Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and gave this disease the 
name COVID-19. While there is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19, 
several off label drugs approved for other indications are being investigated in 
clinical trials across the globe. In the last decade, theranostic nanoparticles 
were reported as promising tool for efficiently and selectively deliver 
therapeutic moieties (i.e. drugs, vaccines, siRNA, peptide) to target sites of 
infection. In addition, they allow monitoring infectious sides and treatment 
responses using noninvasive imaging modalities. While intranasal delivery was 
proposed as the preferred administration route for therapeutic agents against 
viral pulmonary diseases, NP-based delivery systems offer numerous benefits to 
overcome challenges associated with mucosal administration, and ensure that 
these agents achieve a concentration that is many times higher than expected in 
the targeted sites of infection while limiting side effects on normal cells. In 
this article, we have shed light on the promising role of nanoparticles as 
effective carriers for therapeutics or immune modulators to help in fighting 
against COVID-19.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus, also known 
as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), has become a 
Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Due to the large infection 
population, broad transmissibility and high mortality, it is urgent to find out 
the efficient and specific methods to prevent and treat COVID-19. As biological 
products have broadly applied in the prevention and treatment of severe epidemic 
diseases, they are promising in blocking novel coronavirus infection. According 
to the research advances of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle 
East respiratory syndrome (MERS), we reviewed the potential application of 
biological products such as interferon, convalescent plasma, intestinal 
micro-ecological regulators, vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, etc. , on 
prevention and treatment of COVID-19. May this review be helpful for conquering 
COVID-19 in the near future.

The world remains cautiously optimistic about a COVID-19 vaccine that is 
relatively safe and efficacious and that offers sufficient long-lasting 
protection/immunity by neutralizing the virus infectivity. However, key 
technical hurdles pertaining to antigen-adjuvant formulation, delivery, and 
manufacturing challenges of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for mRNA vaccines and 
stability of formulations need to be addressed for successful product 
development and stockpiling. In addition, the dosage form, the dosage level and 
regimen for eliciting a protective immune response remain to be established. The 
high dependence of global supply chains and demand-supply to sourcing quality 
raw materials, glassware and other supplies, along with the stress on existing 
production capacities and platform-specific manufacturing challenges could 
impede vaccine development and access. This article provides critical analysis 
of vaccine development processes and unit operations that can derail the 
pandemic response, and also extends to other emerging infectious disease 
development efforts - issues that take on added significance given the global 
mandate for an accelerated and at-risk development path to tackle the COVID-19 
pandemic.

INTRODUCTION: The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus 
demands the development of strategies not only to detect or inactivate the 
virus, but to treat it (therapeutically and prophylactically). COVID-19 is not 
only a critical threat for the population with risk factors, but also generates 
a dramatic economic impact in terms of morbidity and the overall interruption of 
economic activities.
AREAS COVERED: Advanced materials are the basis of several technologies that 
could diminish the impact of COVID-19: biosensors might allow early virus 
detection, nanosized vaccines are powerful agents that could prevent viral 
infections, and nanosystems with antiviral activity could bind the virus for 
inactivation or destruction upon application of an external stimulus. Herein all 
these methods are discussed under the light of cutting-edge technologies and the 
previously reported prototypes targeting enveloped viruses similar to 
SARS-CoV-2. This analysis was derived from an extensive scientific literature 
search (including pubmed) performed on April 2020.
EXPERT OPINION: Perspectives on how biosensors, vaccines, and antiviral 
nanosystems can be implemented to fight COVID-19 are envisioned; identifying the 
approaches that can be implemented in the short term and those that deserve long 
term research to cope with respiratory viruses-related pandemics in the future.

The outbreak of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection poses a serious 
threat to global public health. Vaccination is an effective way to prevent the 
epidemic of the virus. 2019-nCoV along with severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
(MERS-CoV) belong to the same β-genus of coronavirus family. Basing on the 
previous experience and the technical platform of developing SARS-CoV and 
MERS-CoV vaccines, scientists from all over the world are working hard and 
quickly on the related fields. There are substantial progress in these fields 
including characterizing the 2019-nCoV virus, identification of candidate 
antigens and epitopes, establishment of animal models, characterizing the immune 
responses, and the design of vaccines. The development of 2019-nCoV vaccines 
covers all types: inactivated virus vaccine, recombinant protein vaccine, viral 
vector-based vaccine, mRNA vaccine, and DNA vaccine, et al. As of March 2020, 
two 2019-nCoV vaccines have entered phase I clinical trials. One is named as 
Ad5-nCoV developed by the Chinese Institute of Biotechnology of the Academy of 
Military Medical Sciences and Tianjin Cansino Biotechnology Inc. Ad5-nCoV is 
based on the replication-defective adenovirus type 5 as the vector to express 
2019-nCoV spike protein. The another vaccine is mRNA-1273 developed by the 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Moderna, Inc.. 
RNA-1273 is an mRNA vaccine expressing 2019-nCoV spike protein. Although the 
rapid development of 2019-nCoV vaccine, it still faces many unknown challenges, 
including the antigenic characteristics of the 2019-nCoV, the influence of 
antigenic variation, the protective immune response of host, the protection of 
the elderly population, and the downstream manufacturing process of the new 
vaccine. The safety and efficacy of vaccines are the first priority for vaccine 
development and should be carefully evaluated.

COVID-19 has rapidly spread all over the world, progressing into a pandemic. 
This situation has urgently impelled many companies and public research 
institutes to concentrate their efforts on research for effective therapeutics. 
Here, we outline the strategies and targets currently adopted in developing a 
vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Based on previous evidence and experience with SARS 
and MERS, the primary focus has been the Spike protein, considered as the ideal 
target for COVID-19 immunotherapies.

The outbreak of Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has posed a serious 
health threat. The increasing number of COVID-19 cases around the world is 
overwhelming hospitals and pushing the global death toll to over 746,000, which 
has pushed the sprint to find new treatment options. In this article, we 
reviewed the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology, transmission, and potential treatment 
strategies.

Of all the solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic, a vaccine is the most attractive. 
With just one shot, people could transform the disease from a global disruptor 
to an easily manageable public health problem. But vaccines can't be whipped up 
overnight.

The current outbreak of novel Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major pandemic 
situation and a catastrophe for humans. COVID-19 is a severe infectious disease 
particularly of the respiratory system characterized by fatal complications such 
as severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS), pneumonia, cardiac 
arrhythmia, kidney failure/ multiple organ failure and even death. Since its 
discovery, the SARS-CoV-2 has spread across 213 countries or territories, 
causing more than 8.5 million people with a rising death toll over 5.5 million 
people (as of June 2020, WHO). In fact, the current looming crisis of COVID-19 
has become an increasingly serious concern to public health. It has affected 
lives of millions of people with severe impact on health systems and economies 
globally. Since there are no specific drugs and/or vaccines available so far, 
combating COVID-19 remains to be a major challenging task. Therefore, 
development of potential and effective treatment regimens 
(prophylactic/therapeutic) is urgently required which could resolve the issue. 
In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the coronavirus, 
disease epidemiology, clinical manifestations and risk factors, replication of 
the virus, pathophysiology and host immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
The therapeutic interventions and prophylactic measures along with precautionary 
measures are the frontline approaches that could be undertaken in order to 
control and prevent the spread of the deadly and highly contagious COVID-19 are 
also detailed herein.

COVID-19 emerged in late 2019 and has rapidly spread through many countries 
globally. The causative SARS-CoV-2 virus was not known until recently, and there 
is little or no natural immunity in human populations. There is an urgent need 
for vaccines and drugs to combat this new pandemic. In just a few months, huge 
efforts and resources by government, academia, and industry have been thrown 
into the race to develop a vaccine. This brief review summarizes and discusses 
the array of technologies being applied to vaccine development, highlighting the 
strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches.

The intense global efforts are directed towards development of vaccines to halt 
the COVID-19 virus pandemic. There are 160 candidate vaccines under clinical 
trials across the world using different molecular targets and techniques. This 
race for the vaccine has several challenges and ethical issues like compressed 
timelines, generation and proper management of resources and finances, risks to 
the participating volunteers due to curtailed research trial processes, 
geopolitical contentions, misinformation through social media and parallel race 
with drugs. We feel that the fundamental principles of ethics: autonomy, 
beneficence, non-maleficence and justice should not be violated in this hastened 
vaccine development process. We recommend constitute a Consortium on a global 
platform to formulate, provide and monitor a comprehensive ethical umbrella to 
the process of vaccine development.

Vaccine solutions rarely reach the public until after an outbreak abates; an 
Ebola vaccine was approved 5 years after peak outbreak and SARS, MERS, and Zika 
vaccines are still in clinical development. Despite massive leaps forward in 
rapid science, other regulatory bottlenecks are hamstringing the global effort 
for pandemic vaccines.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the strain of 
coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory 
illness. COVID-19 has now become a global public health crisis causing alarming 
numbers of morbidity and mortality. Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic started 
scientists, researchers, universities, companies, and institutions all around 
the world have been endeavoring to discover a potential treatment for COVID-19. 
Numerous studies and clinical trials on vaccines and drugs for the prevention 
and treatment of COVID-19 are underway across the world. However, the 
uncertainty around the efficacy and safety of various treatment regimens have 
become one of the biggest challenges in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2. This 
paper is a narrative review of articles regarding the various treatments and 
vaccines being tested for the SARS-CoV-2, available in the PubMed database along 
with Google Scholar. There are ongoing clinical trials on potential drugs such 
as remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, and 
hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids tocilizumab, azithromycin, anakinra, etc. 
and other therapeutic modalities like convalescent plasma therapy. Likewise, 
vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are being developed and tested, including mRNA, 
non-replicating viral vector, DNA, protein subunit candidate vaccines, etc. 
Although some early-stage clinical trials and studies on these drugs and 
vaccines have shown positive results, definitive and conclusive results are yet 
to be obtained. Keywords: COVID-19; antiviral drugs; COVID-19 treatment; 
COVID-19 vaccine; SARS-CoV-2.

This paper makes the case for immediate planning for a COVID-19 vaccination 
uptake strategy in advance of vaccine availability for two reasons: first, the 
need to build a consensus about the order in which groups of the population will 
get access to the vaccine; second, to reduce any fear and concerns that exist in 
relation to vaccination and to create demand for vaccines. A key part of this 
strategy is to counter the anti-vaccination movement that is already promoting 
hesitancy and resistance. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic there has 
been a tsunami of misinformation and conspiracy theories that have the potential 
to reduce vaccine uptake. To make matters worse, sections of populations in many 
countries display low trust in governments and official information about the 
pandemic and how the officials are tackling it. This paper aims to set out in 
short form critical guidelines that governments and regional bodies should take 
to enhance the impact of a COVID-19 vaccination strategy. We base our 
recommendations on a review of existing best practice guidance. This paper aims 
to assist those responsible for promoting COVID-19 vaccine uptake to digest the 
mass of guidance that exists and formulate an effective locally relevant 
strategy. A summary of key guidelines is presented based on best practice 
guidance.

The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has highlighted 
the threat that highly pathogenic coronaviruses have on global health security 
and the imminent need to design an effective vaccine for prevention purposes. 
Although several attempts have been made to develop vaccines against human 
coronavirus infections since the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, there is no available licensed vaccine yet. A 
better understanding of previous coronavirus vaccine studies may help to design 
a vaccine for the newly emerged virus, SARS-CoV-2, that may also cover other 
pathogenic coronaviruses as a potentially universal vaccine. In general, 
coronavirus spike protein is the major antigen for the vaccine design as it can 
induce neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity. By considering the high 
genetic similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, here, protective immunity 
against SARS-CoV spike subunit vaccine candidates in animal models has been 
reviewed to gain advances that can facilitate coronavirus vaccine development in 
the near future.

The explosive spread of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that a vaccine will be required to 
end this global pandemic. Progress in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development to date has 
been faster than for any other pathogen in history. Multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccine 
candidates have been evaluated in preclinical models and are currently in 
clinical trials. In this Perspective, we discuss three topics that are critical 
for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development: antigen selection and engineering, 
preclinical challenge studies in non-human primate models, and immune correlates 
of protection.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: This article examines whether women are less prone than 
men to Covid-19 infections and their complications.
DATA SOURCES: We reviewed available databases and searched systematically for 
publications. To be taken into account, data had to be broken down by gender. 
There was no study evaluation nor quantification synthesis, due to the large 
heterogeneity of the studies. Nineteen databases were selected. 73 publications 
were considered and 33 were selected, to which 12 more were added.
RESULTS: Globally, the proportion of men and women who tested positive is 
comparable. However, men are about 60 % more likely to be severely ill or to die 
from the complications of Covid-19 than are women.
LIMITATIONS: The study was hampered by a large heterogeneity in testing and 
reporting of the data.
CONCLUSIONS: Although in the pandemic men die more frequently than women from 
Covid-19, it is not clear whether this is due to biological differences between 
men and women, differences in behavioral habits, or differences in the rates of 
co-morbidities.
IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Countries and studies should report their data by 
age, gender and co-morbidities. This may have implications in terms of 
vaccination strategies, the choice of treatments and future consequences for 
long-term health issues concerning gender equality.

The pandemic outbreak of COVID-19, caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, created an 
unprecedented challenge to global public health system and biomedical community. 
Vaccination is an effective way to prevent viral infection, stop its 
transmission, and develop herd immunity. Rapid progress and advances have been 
made to date in the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Currently, more than 115 
vaccine candidates have been developed from different technology platforms with 
several of them in clinical trials. Most of those vaccine candidates are 
developed based on the experience with other coronaviruses with an aim to induce 
neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein or its different 
receptor binding domains. Here, we discuss the promise, potential scientific 
challenges, and future directions for the development of a safe and effective 
COVID-19 vaccine. We also emphasize the importance of a better understanding of 
the infection pathogenesis and host defense mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 
infection.

To rapidly evaluate the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine candidates, 
prioritizing vaccine trial sites in areas with high expected disease incidence 
can speed endpoint accrual and shorten trial duration. Mathematical and 
statistical forecast models can inform the process of site selection, 
integrating available data sources and facilitating comparisons across 
locations. We recommend the use of ensemble forecast modeling - combining 
projections from independent modeling groups - to guide investigators 
identifying suitable sites for COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials. We describe an 
appropriate structure for this process, including minimum requirements, 
suggested output, and a user-friendly tool for displaying results. Importantly, 
we advise that this process be repeated regularly throughout the trial, to 
inform decisions about enrolling new participants at existing sites with waning 
incidence versus adding entirely new sites. These types of data-driven models 
can support the implementation of flexible efficacy trials tailored to the 
outbreak setting.

Understanding the properties and mechanisms by which antibodies provide 
protection is essential to defining immunity. Although neutralizing antibodies 
have been proposed as a potential key mechanism of protection against many viral 
pathogens, antibodies mediate additional immune functions that may have both 
protective and pathological consequences. Dissecting these properties against 
SARS-CoV-2 is likely necessary for defining metrics of immunity that will inform 
the design of vaccines and therapeutics and improve clinical management.

Beyond neutralization, antibodies have immune-modulating functions that can be 
protective but, in some cases, can enhance pathology. Understanding these 
functions is critical for the development of safe vaccines and antibody 
therapies for COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged, becoming a global threat, affecting directly 
all human beings owing to its morbidity and mortality and indirectly, due to the 
enormous economic and psychological impact produced by social isolation, the 
most effective measure so far, but unsustainable for a long period. The 
scientific effort to understand and control SARS-CoV-2 transmission and clinical 
impact has been huge, and important achievements are highlighted in this review. 
Diagnosis is central and is the first step in recognizing and fighting any 
infectious agent. Instrumental to that is the quality of the data, relying on 
serological and molecular surveys in addition to trustworthy clinical records. 
However, the fast spread of a virus adapted for human-to-human respiratory 
transmission raised a demand for millions of molecular tests that are simply not 
available. Several candidate drugs are under evaluation in clinical trials. 
Those with an already recognized safety profile are more auspicious, since, if 
proven effective, can cut several steps of production and phase 2 and 3 trials. 
More than one hundred vaccine prototypes are in different stages of development, 
however, safety and efficacy evaluations cannot be obviated, implicating, most 
optimistically, in at least months for us to have an effective immunization, the 
definite measure to allow a safe return to the pre-pandemic lifestyle. Science 
has never been more necessary and present in daily life. Relying on the best of 
human wit is the only way out to this pandemic, saving as many lives as 
possible.

The extensive efforts around the globe are being made to develop a suitable 
vaccine against COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2). An effective vaccine should be able 
to induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies to prevent the virus from 
attaching to the host cell receptors. However, to elicit the protective levels 
of antibodies, a vaccine may require multiple doses or assistance from other 
immunostimulatory molecules. Further, the vaccine should be able to induce 
protective levels of antibodies rapidly with the least amount of antigen used. 
This decreases the cost of a vaccine and makes it affordable. As the pandemic 
has hit most countries across the globe, there will be an overwhelming demand 
for the vaccine in a quick time. Incorporating a suitable adjuvant in a 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine may address these requirements. This review paper will 
discuss the experimental results of the adjuvanted vaccine studies with similar 
coronaviruses (CoVs) which might be useful to select an appropriate adjuvant for 
a vaccine against rapidly emergingSARS-CoV-2. We also discuss the current 
progress in the development of adjuvanted vaccines against the disease.

The COVID-19 outbreak has become a global pandemic responsible for over 
2,000,000 confirmed cases and over 126,000 deaths worldwide. In this study, we 
examined the immunogenicity of CHO-expressed recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1-Fc fusion 
protein in mice, rabbits, and monkeys as a potential candidate for a COVID-19 
vaccine. We demonstrate that the S1-Fc fusion protein is extremely immunogenic, 
as evidenced by strong antibody titers observed by day 7. Strong virus 
neutralizing activity was observed on day 14 in rabbits immunized with the S1-Fc 
fusion protein using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Most importantly, in 
<20 days and three injections of the S1-Fc fusion protein, two monkeys developed 
higher virus neutralizing titers than a recovered COVID-19 patient in a live 
SARS-CoV-2 infection assay. Our data strongly suggests that the CHO-expressed 
SARS-CoV-2 S1-Fc recombinant protein could be a strong candidate for vaccine 
development against COVID-19.

The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 into a global pandemic within a few months of onset 
motivates the development of a rapidly scalable vaccine. Here, we present a 
self-amplifying RNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein encapsulated within a 
lipid nanoparticle (LNP) as a vaccine. We observe remarkably high and 
dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody titers in mouse sera, as well as 
robust neutralization of both a pseudo-virus and wild-type virus. Upon further 
characterization we find that the neutralization is proportional to the quantity 
of specific IgG and of higher magnitude than recovered COVID-19 patients. saRNA 
LNP immunizations induce a Th1-biased response in mice, and there is no 
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) observed. Finally, we observe high cellular 
responses, as characterized by IFN-γ production, upon re-stimulation with 
SARS-CoV-2 peptides. These data provide insight into the vaccine design and 
evaluation of immunogenicity to enable rapid translation to the clinic.

trials. In June 2020, we surveyed 13,426 people in 19 countries to determine 
potential acceptance rates and factors influencing acceptance of a COVID-19 
vaccine. Of these, 71.5% of participants reported that they would be very or 
somewhat likely to take a COVID-19 vaccine, and 61.4% reported that they would 
accept their employer's recommendation to do so. Differences in acceptance rates 
ranged from almost 90% (in China) to less than 55% (in Russia). Respondents 
reporting higher levels of trust in information from government sources were 
more likely to accept a vaccine and take their employer's advice to do so.

A TV debate in April 2020 between two French doctors regarding the benefits of 
testing a coronavirus vaccine in Africa where there are no masks or treatments 
available has led to international criticism. This case highlights a problematic 
ethical double standard in multinational clinical research: trials that would be 
considered unethical in high income countries (e.g., placebo-controlled where 
there is an existing treatment) are nonetheless justified in 
low-and-middle-income countries because the existing standards of care are less 
(i.e., no access to a treatment). Underlying this ethical double standard in 
some multinational clinical trials is a moral imperialism and persistent 
colonialist thinking that must be rejected.

The emergence and rapid expansion of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) require 
the development of effective countermeasures especially a vaccine to provide 
active acquired immunity against the virus. This study presented a comprehensive 
vaccinomics approach applied to the complete protein data published so far in 
the National Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI) coronavirus data 
hub. We identified non-structural protein 8 (Nsp8), 3C-like proteinase, and 
spike glycoprotein as potential targets for immune responses to COVID-19. 
Epitopes prediction illustrated both B-cell and T-cell epitopes associated with 
the mentioned proteins. The shared B and T-cell epitopes: DRDAAMQRK and 
QARSEDKRA of Nsp8, EDMLNPNYEDL and EFTPFDVVR of 3C-like proteinase, and 
VNNSYECDIPI of the spike glycoprotein are regions of high potential interest and 
have a high likelihood of being recognized by the human immune system. The 
vaccine construct of the epitopes shows stimulation of robust primary immune 
responses and high level of interferon gamma. Also, the construct has the best 
conformation with respect to the tested innate immune receptors involving 
vigorous molecular mechanics and solvation energy. Designing of vaccination 
strategies that target immune response focusing on these conserved epitopes 
could generate immunity that not only provide cross protection across 
Betacoronaviruses but additionally resistant to virus evolution.

Trained immunity is a type of non-specific memory-like immune response induced 
by some pathogens and vaccines, such as BCG, which can confer 
antigen-independent protection against a wide variety of pathogens. The BCG 
vaccine has been extensively used to protect against tuberculosis for almost a 
100 years. Interestingly, this vaccine reduces children's mortality caused by 
infections unrelated to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, a phenomenon 
thought to be due to the induction of trained immunity. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic 
has infected, as of April 22, 2020, 2,623,231 people globally, causing a major 
public health problem worldwide. Currently, no vaccine or treatment is available 
to control this pandemic. We analyzed the number of positive cases and deaths in 
different countries and correlated them with the inclusion of BCG vaccination at 
birth in their national vaccination programs. Interestingly, those countries 
where BCG vaccination is given at birth have shown a lower contagion rate and 
fewer COVID-19-related deaths, suggesting that this vaccine may induce trained 
immunity that could confer some protection for SARS-CoV-2.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable 
and pathogenic pneumonia-causing disease, which is caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, resulting in millions of deaths globally. 
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 may coexist with human 
populations for a long time. Therefore, high-effective COVID-19 vaccines are an 
urgent need.
RECENT FINDINGS: Vaccines help in the development of long-lasting humoral or 
cellular immunity, or both, by exposing individuals to antigens that induce an 
immunological response and memory prior to infections with live pathogens. New 
vaccine technologies, such as viral vectors and nucleic acid-based vaccines, 
which represent highly versatile technologies, may allow for faster vaccine 
manufacture and scale up production.
SUMMARY: We summarized the recent progress made in relation to COVID-19 vaccine 
development using several promising technologies, with particular emphasis on 
advancements that are currently at the clinical trial stage.

In light of the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as other 
viral outbreaks in the 21st century, there is a dire need for new diagnostic and 
therapeutic strategies to combat infectious diseases worldwide. As a convergence 
science, tissue engineering has traditionally focused on the application of 
engineering principles to biological systems, collaboration across disciplines, 
and rapid translation of technologies from the benchtop to the bedside. Given 
these strengths, tissue engineers are particularly well suited to apply their 
skill set to the current crisis and viral outbreaks in general. This work 
introduces the basics of virology and epidemiology for tissue engineers, and 
highlights important developments in the field of tissue engineering relevant to 
the current pandemic, including in vitro model systems, vaccine technology, and 
small-molecule drug delivery. COVID-19 serves as a call to arms for scientists 
across all disciplines, and tissue engineers are well trained to be leaders and 
contributors in this time of need. Impact statement Given the steep mortality 
caused by the recent novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, there is clear need 
for advances in diagnostics and therapeutics for viral outbreaks. Tissue 
engineering has the potential for critical impact on clinical outcomes in viral 
outbreaks. Tissue engineers, if mobilized, could play key roles as leaders in 
the outbreak, given their ability to apply engineering principles to biological 
processes, experience in collaborative environments, and penchant for 
technological translation from benchtop to bedside. In this work, three areas 
pioneered by tissue engineers that could be applied to the current COVID-19 
crisis and future viral outbreaks are highlighted.

The global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV 
and HCoV-19) has posed serious threats to public health and economic stability 
worldwide, thus calling for development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other 
emerging and reemerging coronaviruses. Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have high 
similarity of their genomic sequences and share the same cellular receptor 
(ACE2), it is essential to learn the lessons and experiences from the 
development of SARS-CoV vaccines for the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In 
this review, we summarized the current knowledge on the advantages and 
disadvantages of the SARS-CoV vaccine candidates and prospected the strategies 
for the development of safe, effective and broad-spectrum coronavirus vaccines 
for prevention of infection by currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other 
emerging and reemerging coronaviruses that may cause future epidemics or 
pandemics.

Amplifying immunogenicity of prospective Covid-19 vaccines by glycoengineering 
the coronavirus glycan-shield to present α-gal epitopes.

Galili U(1).

(1)Department of Medicine, Rush Medical School, Chicago, IL, USA. Electronic 
address: Uri.Galili@rcn.com.

The many carbohydrate chains on Covid-19 coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and its 
S-protein form a glycan-shield that masks antigenic peptides and decreases 
uptake of inactivated virus or S-protein vaccines by APC. Studies on inactivated 
influenza virus and recombinant gp120 of HIV vaccines indicate that 
glycoengineering of glycan-shields to present α-gal epitopes 
(Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc-R) enables harnessing of the natural anti-Gal antibody for 
amplifying vaccine efficacy, as evaluated in mice producing anti-Gal. The α-gal 
epitope is the ligand for the natural anti-Gal antibody which constitutes ~1% of 
immunoglobulins in humans. Upon administration of vaccines presenting α-gal 
epitopes, anti-Gal binds to these epitopes at the vaccination site and forms 
immune complexes with the vaccines. These immune complexes are targeted for 
extensive uptake by APC as a result of binding of the Fc portion of 
immunocomplexed anti-Gal to Fc receptors on APC. This anti-Gal mediated 
effective uptake of vaccines by APC results in 10-200-fold higher anti-viral 
immune response and in 8-fold higher survival rate following challenge with a 
lethal dose of live influenza virus, than same vaccines lacking α-gal epitopes. 
It is suggested that glycoengineering of carbohydrate chains on the 
glycan-shield of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or on S-protein vaccines, for presenting 
α-gal epitopes, will have similar amplifying effects on vaccine efficacy. α-Gal 
epitope synthesis on coronavirus vaccines can be achieved with recombinant 
α1,3galactosyltransferase, replication of the virus in cells with high 
α1,3galactosyltransferase activity as a result of stable transfection of cells 
with several copies of the α1,3galactosyltransferase gene (GGTA1), or by 
transduction of host cells with replication defective adenovirus containing this 
gene. In addition, recombinant S-protein presenting multiple α-gal epitopes on 
the glycan-shield may be produced in glycoengineered yeast or bacteria 
expression systems containing the corresponding glycosyltransferases. 
Prospective Covid-19 vaccines presenting α-gal epitopes may provide better 
protection than vaccines lacking this epitope because of increased uptake by 
APC.

Researchers, engineers, and medical doctors are made aware of the severity of 
the COVID-19 infection and act quickly against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 using 
a large variety of tools. In this review, a panoply of nanoscience and 
nanotechnology approaches show how these disciplines can help the medical, 
technical, and scientific communities to fight the pandemic, highlighting the 
development of nanomaterials for detection, sanitation, therapies, and vaccines. 
SARS-CoV-2, which can be regarded as a functional core-shell nanoparticle (NP), 
can interact with diverse materials in its vicinity and remains attached for 
variable times while preserving its bioactivity. These studies are critical for 
the appropriate use of controlled disinfection systems. Other nanotechnological 
approaches are also decisive for the development of improved novel testing and 
diagnosis kits of coronavirus that are urgently required. Therapeutics are based 
on nanotechnology strategies as well and focus on antiviral drug design and on 
new nanoarchitectured vaccines. A brief overview on patented work is presented 
that emphasizes nanotechnology applied to coronaviruses. Finally, some comments 
are made on patents of the initial technological responses to COVID-19 that have 
already been put in practice.

COVID-19 vaccines are the most important tool to stem the pandemic. They are 
being developed with unprecedented global collaboration and accelerated 
timelines to achieve WHO Emergency Use Listing, while using regulatory pathways 
through national regulatory authorities. Alongside preparations to ensure 
equitable access to the vaccines among people globally, preparations must be 
made within countries for COVID-19 vaccines safety surveillance on an urgent 
basis. Safety surveillance must be capable of investigating adverse events of 
special interest (AESI) and adverse events following immunization to determine a 
change in the benefit-risk profile of the vaccine, and to be able to anticipate 
coincidental events that might be attributed to the vaccine. Active surveillance 
systems should calculate the incidence of background rates of AESI prior to 
vaccine roll out. These background rates vary tremendously across regions, 
populations and case ascertainment methods. Active surveillance systems must be 
established or strengthened now, (including in LMIC), to calculate the 
background rates. Utilizing standardized case definitions and global standards 
for AESI will help in harmonization. Vaccine safety communication plans should 
be developed. Expanding the global vaccine safety system to meet the needs of 
COVID-19 and other emergency and routine use vaccines is a priority currently.

For rapid response against the prevailing COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19), it 
is a global imperative to exploit the immunogenicity of existing formulations 
for safe and efficient vaccines. As the most accessible adjuvant, aluminum 
hydroxide (alum) is still the sole employed adjuvant in most countries. However, 
alum tends to attach on the membrane rather than entering the dendritic cells 
(DCs), leading to the absence of intracellular transfer and process of the 
antigens, and thus limits T-cell-mediated immunity. To address this, alum is 
packed on the squalene/water interphase is packed, forming an alum-stabilized 
Pickering emulsion (PAPE). "Inheriting" from alum and squalene, PAPE 
demonstrates a good biosafety profile. Intriguingly, with the dense array of 
alum on the oil/water interphase, PAPE not only adsorbs large quantities of 
SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) antigens, but also 
harbors a higher affinity for DC uptake, which provokes the uptake and 
cross-presentation of the delivered antigens. Compared with alum-treated groups, 
more than six times higher antigen-specific antibody titer and three-fold more 
IFN-γ-secreting T cells are induced, indicating the potent humoral and cellular 
immune activations. Collectively, the data suggest that PAPE may provide 
potential insights toward a safe and efficient adjuvant platform for the 
enhanced COVID-19 vaccinations.

Controlled human challenge trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates could 
accelerate the testing and potential rollout of efficacious vaccines. By 
replacing conventional phase 3 testing of vaccine candidates, such trials may 
subtract many months from the licensure process, making efficacious vaccines 
available more quickly. Obviously, challenging volunteers with this live virus 
risks inducing severe disease and possibly even death. However, we argue that 
such studies, by accelerating vaccine evaluation, could reduce the global burden 
of coronavirus-related mortality and morbidity. Volunteers in such studies could 
autonomously authorize the risks to themselves, and their net risk could be 
acceptable if participants comprise healthy young adults, who are at relatively 
low risk of serious disease following natural infection, if they have a high 
baseline risk of natural infection, and if during the trial they receive 
frequent monitoring and, following any infection, the best available care.

This special issue of the Turkish Journal of Medical Sciences is dedicated to 
providing scientific advances in the process of better understanding the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the COVID-19 infection. The special issue is 
published in a special time in which science-based approaches, cocreation-based 
collaboration, and the effective utilization and integration of competences have 
a crucial role during the race against time while combating the COVID-19 
pandemic. In this process, the Scientific and Technological Research Council of 
Turkey (TÜBİTAK), which publishes academic journals including the Turkish 
Journal of Medical Sciences, has taken rapid action to mobilize the research 
community. This includes forming new scientific coalitions in record time, the 
opening of new calls across the research ecosystem, the organization of a 
virtual scientific conference, and the launch of a new portal in support of 
cocreation processes and open science. In addition, various teleconferences that 
bring together various disciplines at the national and international level have 
taken place. All of these efforts provide multiple venues to support the common 
effort of combating the COVID-19 pandemic with R&D and development as a common 
objective. The sharing of evidence-based knowledge and scientific progress is an 
effective approach towards providing important contributions for combating the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The research articles that are contained in this special 
issue of the Turkish Journal of Medical Sciences involves a special collection 
dedicated to COVID-19. This short communication aims to provide an introduction 
of the major initiatives that have been taken in the scientific landscape with a 
focus on Turkey.

The recently identified SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 
pandemic has uncovered the age-associated vulnerability in the burden of disease 
and put aging research in the spotlight. The limited data available indicates 
that COVID-19 should be referred to as a gerolavic (from Greek, géros "old man" 
and epilavís, "harmful") infection because the infection rates, severity, and 
lethality are substantially higher in the population aged 60 and older. This is 
primarily due to comorbidity but may be partially due to immunosenescence, 
decreased immune function in the elderly, and general loss of function, fitness, 
and increased frailty associated with aging. Immunosenescence is a major factor 
affecting vaccination response, as well as the severity and lethality of 
infectious diseases. While vaccination reduces infection rates, and therapeutic 
interventions reduce the severity and lethality of infections, these 
interventions have limitations. Previous studies showed that postulated 
geroprotectors, such as sirolimus (rapamycin) and its close derivative rapalog 
everolimus (RAD001), decreased infection rates in a small sample of elderly 
patients. This article presents a review of the limited literature available on 
geroprotective and senoremediative interventions that may be investigated to 
decrease the disease burden of gerolavic infections. This article also 
highlights a need for rigorous clinical validation of deep aging clocks as 
surrogate markers of biological age. These could be used to assess the need for, 
and efficacy of, geroprotective and senoremediative interventions and provide 
better protection for elderly populations from gerolavic infections. This 
article does not represent medical advice and the medications described are not 
yet licensed or recommended as immune system boosters, as they have not 
undergone clinical evaluation for this purpose.

Increasing evidence points to host Th17 inflammatory responses as contributing 
to the severe lung pathology and mortality of lower respiratory tract infections 
from coronaviruses. This includes host inflammatory and cytokine responses to 
COVID-19 caused by the SARS-2 coronavirus (SARS CoV2). From studies conducted in 
laboratory animals, there are additional concerns about immune enhancement and 
the role of potential host immunopathology resulting from experimental human 
COVID-19 vaccines. Here we summarize evidence suggesting there may be partial 
overlap between the underlying immunopathologic processes linked to both 
coronavirus infection and vaccination, and a role for Th17 in immune enhancement 
and eosinophilic pulmonary immunopathology. Such findings help explain the link 
between viral-vectored coronavirus vaccines and immune enhancement and its 
reduction through alum adjuvants. Additional research may also clarify links 
between COVID-19 pulmonary immunopathology and heart disease.

Background: The newly identified coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV has posed a 
serious global health threat. According to the latest report (18-February-2020), 
it has infected more than 72,000 people globally and led to deaths of more than 
1,016 people in China. Methods: The 2019 novel coronavirus proteome was aligned 
to a curated database of viral immunogenic peptides. The immunogenicity of 
detected peptides and their binding potential to HLA alleles was predicted by 
immunogenicity predictive models and NetMHCpan 4.0. Results: We report in silico 
identification of a comprehensive list of immunogenic peptides that can be used 
as potential targets for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) vaccine development. 
First, we found 28 nCoV peptides identical to Severe acute respiratory 
syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS CoV) that have previously been characterized 
immunogenic by T cell assays. Second, we identified 48 nCoV peptides having a 
high degree of similarity with immunogenic peptides deposited in The Immune 
Epitope Database (IEDB). Lastly, we conducted a de novo search of 2019-nCoV 
9-mer peptides that i) bind to common HLA alleles in Chinese and European 
population and ii) have T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognition potential by 
positional weight matrices and a recently developed immunogenicity algorithm, 
iPred, and identified in total 63 peptides with a high immunogenicity potential. 
Conclusions: Given the limited time and resources to develop vaccine and 
treatments for 2019-nCoV, our work provides a shortlist of candidates for 
experimental validation and thus can accelerate development pipeline.

Today it remains unclear why children seem to be less likely to get infected by 
COVID-19 or why they appear to be less symptomatic after infections. All 
individuals, especially children, are exposed to various viruses including human 
coronavirus (CoVs) that can generally lead to respiratory infections. We 
hypothesize that recurrent CoVs exposure may induce an effective antiviral B and 
T-cell-mediated adaptive immune response, which could also be protective against 
COVID-19. Based on the high-homology between the Spike protein epitopes of 
taxonomically-related coronaviruses, we theorize that past/recurrent contact 
with CoVs might shield children also against the circulating COVID-19 through a 
possible neutralizing antibody response previously CoVs-induced. This would open 
up possible lines of research for the development of live-attenuated virus 
vaccines from CoVs. Future research is desirable to confirm or disprove such 
hypothesis.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel disease caused by the severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 virus that was first 
detected in December of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has rapidly spread worldwide. 
The search for a suitable vaccine as well as effective therapeutics for the 
treatment of COVID-19 is underway. Drug repurposing screens provide a useful and 
effective solution for identifying potential therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. 
For example, the experimental drug remdesivir, originally developed for Ebola 
virus infections, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as an 
emergency use treatment of COVID-19. However, the efficacy and toxicity of this 
drug need further improvements. In this review, we discuss recent findings on 
the pathology of coronaviruses and the drug targets for the treatment of 
COVID-19. Both SARS-CoV-2-specific inhibitors and broad-spectrum anticoronavirus 
drugs against SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and 
SARS-CoV-2 will be valuable additions to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 armament. A 
multitarget treatment approach with synergistic drug combinations containing 
different mechanisms of action may be a practical therapeutic strategy for the 
treatment of severe COVID-19. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Understanding the biology 
and pathology of RNA viruses is critical to accomplish the challenging task of 
developing vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. This review highlights 
the anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug targets and therapeutic development strategies for 
COVID-19 treatment.

The recently emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is 
rapidly spreading in the world. The exponentially expanding threat of SARS-CoV-2 
to global health highlights the urgent need for a vaccine. Herein we show the 
rapid development of a novel, highly efficient, and safe COVID-19 vaccine using 
a rabies virus-based vector that has proven to be an efficient vaccine against 
several emerging infectious diseases. This study reports that both a live and an 
inactivated rabies virus containing the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein induces 
potent virus-neutralizing antibodies at much higher levels than seen in the sera 
of convalescent patients. In summary, the results provided here warrant further 
development of this safe and established vaccine platform against COVID-19.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused COVID-19 
disease in China. So far, no vaccine has licensed to protect against infection 
with COVID-19, therefore an effective COVID-19 vaccine needed. The aim of this 
study was to predict antigenic peptides of SARS-CoV-2 for designing the COVID-19 
vaccine using immunoinformatic analysis. In this study, T and B-cell epitopes of 
S protein were predicted and screened based on the antigenicity, toxicity, 
allergenicity, and cross-reactivity with human proteomes. The epitopes were 
joined by the appropriate linker. LT-IIc as an adjuvant was attached to the end 
of the structure. The secondary and 3D structure of the vaccine was predicted. 
The refinement process was performed to improve the quality of the 3D model 
structure; the validation process is performed using the Ramachandran plot and 
ProSA z-score. The proposed vaccine's binding affinity to the HLA-A11:01 and 
HLA-DRB1_01:01 molecule was evaluated by molecular docking. Using molecular 
dynamics, the stability of vaccine-HLA complexes was also evaluated. Finally, in 
silico gene cloning was performed in the pET30a (+) vector. The findings suggest 
that the current vaccine may be a promising vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 
infection.

The limited case cluster of atypical pneumonia detected in central China in 
December 2019, now known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19), converted into 
a million confirmed cases worldwide in only 10 weeks. Declared a pandemic by the 
World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 (WHO, 2020) and passing the 3 
million mark on 27 April, the world is under formidable strain with respect to 
public health, economy and personal life. Time and again we are alerted about 
unforeseen, new effects of this disease, which brings to mind the terms "known 
unknowns" and "unknown unknowns" used by former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald 
Rumsfield when referring to the lack of evidence of weapons of mass destruction 
in Iraq ahead of the second Gulf war, a fitting vocabulary as we again are faced 
with mass destruction, though this time of a different kind.

The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease that has taken 
the lives of many around the world. It is caused by severe acute respiratory 
syndrome-corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). To date, the USA, Italy, Spain, France, 
Russia, and the UK have been hit the hardest by the virus. However, death counts 
are still rising. Some nations have managed to "flatten" the death rate via 
protective measures such physical distancing, quarantine measures, and 
therapeutic management. The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus comprises of S 
proteins, M proteins, E proteins, hemagglutinin esterases, nucleocapsid 
proteins, and a 30-kb RNA genome. Viral proteases cleave these polyproteins and 
RNA-dependent polymerases replicate the genome. Currently, there are no 
effective therapies against this new disease. Numerous investigators are 
developing novel protease inhibitors, some of which have made it into clinical 
trials. Researchers are also attempting to develop a vaccine. In this review 
paper, we discuss the latest therapeutic developments against COVID-19.

COVID-19 is the pandemic outbreak that is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus from 
December, 2019. Human race do not know the curative measure of this devastating 
disease. In today's era of nanotechnology, it may use its knowledge to develop 
molecular vaccine to combat this disease. In this article we are intended to 
propose a hypothesis on the development of a vaccine that is molecular in nature 
to work against COVID-19. The nanoconjugate may comprise with the inorganic 
nanoparticle layered double hydroxide intercalated with shRNA-plasmid that have 
a sequence targeting towards the viral genome or viral mRNA. This nanoconjugate 
may be used as a nasal spray to deliver the shRNA-plasmid to the target site. 
The nanoconjugate will have several advantages such as they are biocompatible, 
they forms as stable knockdown to the target cells and they are stable in the 
nasal mucosa.

In the midst of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic and 
its attendant morbidity and mortality, safe and efficacious vaccines are needed 
that induce protective and long-lived immune responses. More than 120 vaccine 
candidates worldwide are in various preclinical and phase 1 to 3 clinical trials 
that include inactivated, live-attenuated, viral-vectored replicating and 
nonreplicating, protein- and peptide-based, and nucleic acid approaches. 
Vaccines will be necessary both for individual protection and for the safe 
development of population-level herd immunity. Public-private partnership 
collaborative efforts, such as the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic 
Interventions and Vaccines mechanism, are key to rapidly identifying safe and 
effective vaccine candidates as quickly and efficiently as possible. In this 
article, we review the major vaccine approaches being taken and issues that must 
be resolved in the quest for vaccines to prevent coronavirus disease 2019. For 
this study, we scanned the PubMed database from 1963 to 2020 for all 
publications using the following search terms in various combinations: SARS, 
MERS, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, vaccine, clinical trial, coronavirus, pandemic, and 
vaccine development. We also did a Web search for these same terms. In addition, 
we examined the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, and other public health authority websites. We excluded abstracts 
and all articles that were not written in English.

The new coronavirus outbreak is an ongoing pandemic that is caused by severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The new coronavirus 
SARS-Cov-2 belongs to the subfamily of β-coronaviruses and shares 79.5% of the 
genetic sequence of SARS-CoV, the causative agent of the epidemic that started 
in 2002 and ended in 2004. Considering the clinical impact of the new outbreak, 
it is highly important to study the potential responses of the human immune 
system during the SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the role of virus-specific T 
cells and by B-lymphocytes. Moreover, specific data on the production of IgG and 
IgM is crucial to allow the rapid identification of the infection. In this paper 
we also described the importance of sensitive and specific rapid test for 
SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, this test represents an important immunological tool aimed 
at identifying the precise phase of the infection in order to undertake a more 
appropriate pharmacological treatment. Lastly, we provided an overview of 
pharmacological treatments aimed to reduce inflammatory processes underlying the 
infection and the need for the discovery of a new vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The pandemic COVID-19 occurring due to novel emerging 
coronavirus-2019 (SARS-CoV-2) is severely affecting the worldwide public health, 
culture, economy and human social behaviour. Till date, there is no approved 
medicine/treatment to cure COVID-19, whereas, vaccine development efforts are 
going on high priority. This review aimed to provide an overview of prior art, 
recent advances, vaccine designing strategies, current scenario, opportunities 
and challenges related to development of coronavirus vaccine.
METHOD: A literature survey was conducted using Scopus, PubMed and Google 
Scholar with the search key as: coronavirus vaccine, SARS vaccine, MERS vaccine 
and COVID-19 vaccine. Articles related to above search query were retrieved, 
sorted, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review.
RESULTS: The genome phylogenetic analysis suggested that genomic sequence of 
SARS-CoV-2 is almost 80% similar to that of SARS-CoV, further both these viruses 
bind to same host cell receptor ACE-2. Hence it is expected that, previously 
available literature data about coronavirus vaccine designing may play crucial 
role in development of rapid vaccine against COVID-19. In view of this, the 
present review discuss (i) existing information (from 2003 to present) about the 
type of vaccine, antigen, immunogenic response, animal model, route of 
administration, adjuvants and current scenario for designing of coronavirus 
vaccine (ii) potential factors and challenges related to rapid development of 
COVID-19 vaccine.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we discuss possible clues/ target sites for designing 
of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus based on prior-art.

Based on the announcement of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018, the 
Wuhan pneumonia caused by an unknown etiology should be recognized as the first 
Disease X. Later, the pathogen was identified to be a novel coronavirus denoted 
2019-nCoV, which has 79.5% and 96% whole genome sequence identify to SARS-CoV 
and bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV-RaTG13), respectively, suggesting 
its potential bat origin. With high human-to-human transmission rate (R0), 
2019-nCoV has quickly spread in China and other countries, resulting in 34,953 
confirmed cases and 725 deaths as of 8 February 2020, thus calling for urgent 
development of therapeutics and prophylactics. Here we suggest renaming 
2019-nCoV as "transmissible acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (TARS-CoV)" 
and briefly review the advancement of research and development of neutralizing 
antibodies and vaccines targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and viral 
fusion inhibitors targeting the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain in spike protein of 
2019-nCoV.

Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) packaged mRNA vaccines have been deployed against 
infectious diseases such as COVID-19, yet their structural features remain 
unclear. Cholesterol, a major constituent within LNPs, contributes to their 
morphology that influences gene delivery. Herein, we examine the structure of 
LNPs containing cholesterol derivatives using electron microscopy, differential 
scanning calorimetry, and membrane fluidity assays. LNPs formulated with C24 
alkyl derivatives of cholesterol show a polymorphic shape and various degrees of 
multilamellarity and lipid partitioning, likely due to phase separation. The 
addition of methyl and ethyl groups to the C24 alkyl tail of the cholesterol 
backbone induces multilamellarity (>50% increase compared to cholesterol), while 
the addition of a double bond induces lipid partitioning (>90% increase compared 
to cholesterol). LNPs with multilamellar and faceted structures, as well as a 
lamellar lipid phase, showed higher gene transfection. Unraveling the structure 
of mRNA-LNPs can enable their rational design toward enhanced gene delivery.

Models have played an important role in policy development to address the 
COVID-19 outbreak from its emergence in China to the current global pandemic. 
Early projections of international spread influenced travel restrictions and 
border closures. Model projections based on the virus's infectiousness 
demonstrated its pandemic potential, which guided the global response to and 
prepared countries for increases in hospitalisations and deaths. Tracking the 
impact of distancing and movement policies and behaviour changes has been 
critical in evaluating these decisions. Models have provided insights into the 
epidemiological differences between higher and lower income countries, as well 
as vulnerable population groups within countries to help design fit-for-purpose 
policies. Economic evaluation and policies have combined epidemic models and 
traditional economic models to address the economic consequences of COVID-19, 
which have informed policy calls for easing restrictions. Social contact and 
mobility models have allowed evaluation of the pathways to safely relax mobility 
restrictions and distancing measures. Finally, models can consider future 
end-game scenarios, including how suppression can be achieved and the impact of 
different vaccination strategies.

The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is progressing at an unparalleled 
speed. As of the 29th of March, there were at least 68 vaccine candidates 
comprising several different vaccine designs, including whole killed virus, 
subunit, attenuated, viral vector, DNA and mRNA vaccines. Whilst it usually 
takes 10-15 years to develop a vaccine, it has only taken just over 9 weeks from 
the publication of the viral genetic sequence for the first vaccine candidate to 
reach clinical testing. Development has been expediated by using existing 
technological platforms and by performing preclinical and clinical testing 
simultaneously.

OBJECTIVES: Development of a vaccine against COVID-19 will be key to controlling 
the pandemic. We need to understand the barriers and facilitators to receiving a 
future COVID-19 vaccine so that we can provide recommendations for the design of 
interventions aimed at maximizing public acceptance.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional UK survey with older adults and patients with chronic 
respiratory disease.
METHODS: During the UK's early April 2020 'lockdown' period, 527 participants 
(311 older adults, mean age = 70.4 years; 216 chronic respiratory participants, 
mean age = 43.8 years) completed an online questionnaire assessing willingness 
to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, perceptions of COVID-19, and intention to receive 
influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. A free text response (n = 502) examined 
barriers and facilitators to uptake. The Behaviour Change Wheel informed the 
analysis of these responses, which were coded to the Theoretical Domains 
Framework (TDF). Behaviour change techniques (BCTs) were identified.
RESULTS: Eighty-six per cent of respondents want to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. 
This was positively correlated with the perception that COVID-19 will persist 
over time, and negatively associated with perceiving the media to have 
over-exaggerated the risk. The majority of barriers and facilitators were mapped 
onto the 'beliefs about consequences' TDF domain, with themes relating to 
personal health, health consequences to others, concerns of vaccine safety, and 
severity of COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: Willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination is currently high 
among high-risk individuals. Mass media interventions aimed at maximizing 
vaccine uptake should utilize the BCTs of information about health, emotional, 
social and environmental consequences, and salience of consequences.

The new virus of the of β-Coronaviruses genus, SARS-CoV-2, is the causative 
agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and is winning a proverbial chess 
match against all players simultaneous, including physicians, clinicians, 
pathologists, doctors, scientists, economists, athletes and politicians. The 
COVID-19 outbreak has seriously threatened public health, killing the most 
vulnerable persons and causing general panic. To stop this disease, effective 
remedies (i.e., drugs, vaccines, personal protection elements, etc.) are 
urgently required. Unfortunately, no registered specific therapies (including 
antiviral therapies, immune-modulating agents and vaccines) are currently 
available to treat coronavirus infections, highlighting an urgent need for 
therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. In this work, fourteen existing small 
molecule drugs or/and experimental drugs selected by experts and examined from 
the point of view of bioavailability via the Lipinski-Veber rules and assessment 
of their physicochemical descriptors. The aim of this study is to discover 
selected pattern similarities and peculiar characteristics that could be useful 
for antiviral drug optimization, drug combination or new antiviral agent design.

In the current era of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has never been more 
interested in the process of vaccine development. While researchers across the 
globe race to find an effective yet safe vaccine to protect populations from the 
newly emergent SARS-CoV-2 virus, more than one-third of the world has been 
subjected to either full or partial lockdown measures. With communities having 
felt the burden of prolonged isolation, finding a safe and efficacious vaccine 
will yield direct beneficial effects on protecting against COVID-19 morbidity 
and mortality and help relieve the psychological and economic load on 
communities living with COVID-19. There is hope that with the extraordinary 
efforts of scientists a vaccine will become available. However, given the global 
public health crisis, development of a COVID-19 vaccine will need to be fast 
tracked through the usual prelicensing development stages and introduced with 
limited clinical trial data compared with those vaccines that are developed 
conventionally over more than a decade. In this scenario, surveillance of the 
vaccine in the real world becomes even more paramount. This responsibility falls 
to observational researchers who can provide an essential safety net by 
continuing to monitor the effectiveness and safety of a COVID-19 vaccine after 
licensing. Postauthorisation observational studies for safety and effectiveness 
are complementary to prelaunch clinical trials and not a replacement. In this 
paper, we highlight the importance of postmarketing studies for future newly 
licensed COVID-19 vaccines and the key epidemiological considerations.

COVID-19 will be with us through the remainder of 2020 and almost certainly 
beyond. New Zealand needs a viable strategy to protect its populace until a 
vaccine is developed and in wide use. Until that time, it makes sense to protect 
the population by putting in place treatments that will be safe and effective, 
such as the use of convalescent sera and the use of direct-acting anti-virals. 
These treatments should be sourced externally or made locally, but steps in this 
direction must now begin as the lockdown ends. New Zealand has the scientists, 
the facilities and the will to make this happen, but the support of the 
government and the population will be needed if this plan is to succeed.

The present pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has been a tough task for the whole world to 
deal with. With the absence of specific drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, 
the situation is very difficult to control. Apart from the absence of specific 
therapies, the lack of knowledge about potential therapeutic targets and 
individual perception is adding to the complications. The present review 
describes the novel SARS-CoV-2 structure, surface proteins, asymptomatic and 
symptomatic transmission in addition to the genotype and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 
along with genetic strains and similarity between SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2. 
Therapeutic strategies such as inhibition of the endocytic pathway and 
suppressing RNA polymerase activity by metal ions, which could be quite 
beneficial for controlling COVID-19, are outlined. The drug repurposing for 
SARS-CoV-2 is discussed in detail along with therapeutic classes such as 
antivirals, antibiotics, and amino quinolones and their probable role in 
suppressing SARS-CoV-2 with reference to case studies. The ongoing clinical 
trials both with respect to drug repurposing and vaccines are summarized along 
with a brief description. The recent advancements and future perspective of 
ongoing research for therapy and detection of SARS-CoV-2 are provided. The 
review, in brief, summarizes epidemiology, therapy and the current scenario for 
combating SARS-CoV-2.

The COVID-19-inducing virus, SARS-CoV2, is likely to remain a threat to human 
health unless efficient drugs or vaccines become available. Given the extent of 
the current pandemic (people in over one hundred countries infected) and its 
disastrous effect on world economy (associated with limitations of human 
rights), speedy drug discovery is critical. In this situation, past investments 
into the development of new (animal-free) approach methods (NAM) for drug 
safety, efficacy, and quality evaluation can be leveraged. For this, we provide 
an overview of repurposing ideas to shortcut drug development times. 
Animal-based testing would be too lengthy, and it largely fails, when a pathogen 
is species-specific or if the desired drug is based on specific features of 
human biology. Fortunately, industry has already largely shifted to NAM, and 
some public funding programs have advanced the development of animal-free 
technologies. For instance, NAM can predict genotoxicity (a major aspect of 
carcinogenicity) within days, human antibodies targeting virus epitopes can be 
generated in molecular biology laboratories within weeks, and various human 
cell-based organoids are available to test virus infectivity and the biological 
processes controlling them. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has formed an 
expert group to pave the way for the use of such approaches for accelerated drug 
development. This situation illustrates the importance of diversification in 
drug discovery strategies and clearly shows the shortcomings of an approach that 
invests 95% of resources into a single technology (animal experimentation) in 
the face of challenges that require alternative approaches.

This review provides an update for the international research community on the 
cell modeling tools that could accelerate the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 
infection mechanisms and could thus speed up the development of vaccines and 
therapeutic agents against COVID-19. Many bioengineering groups are actively 
developing frontier tools that are capable of providing realistic 
three-dimensional (3D) models for biological research, including cell culture 
scaffolds, microfluidic chambers for the culture of tissue equivalents and 
organoids, and implantable windows for intravital imaging. Here, we review the 
most innovative study models based on these bioengineering tools in the context 
of virology and vaccinology. To make it easier for scientists working on 
SARS-CoV-2 to identify and apply specific tools, we discuss how they could 
accelerate the discovery and preclinical development of antiviral drugs and 
vaccines, compared to conventional models.

SARS-CoV-2 had already killed more than 400,000 patients around the world 
according to data on 7 June 2020. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is 
developed from live-attenuated Mycobacterium bovis, which is a microorganism 
found in a cow. Discovered by Dr. Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin since 1921, 
the BCG has served as a protection against tuberculosis and its complications. 
It is noticeable that countries which use mandatory BCG vaccination approach had 
lower COVID-19 infection and death rate. Current review aims to clarify this 
issue through epidemiological illustration of correlation between national BCG 
immunization and COVID-19 mortality, in addition to biological background of 
BCG-induced immunity Epidemiological data shows that universal BCG policy 
countries have lower median mortality rate compare to countries with past 
universal BCG policy and non-mass immunization BCG. (18 May 2020). Still, the 
links between BCG vaccination and better COVID-19 situation in certain countries 
are unclear, and more data on actual infection rate using SAR-CoV-2 antibody 
testing in large population sample is crucial for disease spreading comparison. 
Two immunological mechanisms, heterologous effects of adaptive immunity and 
trained innate immunity which induced by BCG vaccination, may explain host 
tolerance against COVID-19 infection, however, there is no direct evidence to 
support this biological background. Clinical trials related to BCG vaccination 
against COVID-19 are under investigation. Without a strong evidence, BCG must 
not be recommended for COVID-19 prevention, although, this should not be 
absolute contraindication. Risk of local and systemic complications from the 
vaccine should be informed to individual, who request BCG immunization.

COVID-19 remains pandemic at the time of writing (September 2020) and it has 
opened up many avenues of research, on itself and on other aspects of medicine 
and science. This collection of Best Practice Guidelines (BPG) and the one 
following will review various aspects of COVID-19. Two papers review schools: 
reported clusters to date globally and the specific preparations made by one 
specific Maltese school to try to avoid/dampen any outbreaks in the school. Some 
economic aspects are also reviewed including the effects of the second wave on 
tourism revenues in Malta and a clarification of how (carefully) raising 
lockdowns is crucial to revive devastated economies. Three papers deal with 
statistics; estimating delay to death from surges of cases, demonstrating the 
second wave globally and by continent, and finally estimating the risk of rare 
and severe hypothetical adverse events after a vaccine has undergone standard 
testing and compares this to estimated death rate/s from COVID-19. The results 
of an influenza and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy questionnaire in Malta's 
healthcare workers are also depicted. One general review reiterates that 
COVID-19 is ageist, sexist, ruthless, dispassionate and opportunistic, and that 
protecting our vulnerable while easing restrictions remains crucial. Another 
review recaps the increased importance of less influenza vaccine hesitancy and 
less presenteeism among health care workers next winter. We dedicate this BPG to 
the ill and to the fallen.

The origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains enigmatic. It is likely to be a 
continuum resulting from inevitable mutations and recombination events. These 
genetic changes keep developing in the present epidemic. Mutations tending to 
deplete the genome in its cytosine content will progressively lead to 
attenuation as a consequence of Muller's ratchet, but this is counteracted by 
recombination when different mutants co-infect the same host, in particular, in 
clusters of infection. Monitoring as a function of time the genome sequences in 
closely related cases is critical to anticipate the future of SARS-CoV-2 and 
hence of COVID-19.

SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has become a global issue which has 
raised the concern of scientific community to design and discover a 
counter-measure against this deadly virus. So far, the pandemic has caused the 
death of hundreds of thousands of people upon infection and spreading. To date, 
no effective vaccine is available which can combat the infection caused by this 
virus. Therefore, this study was conducted to design possible epitope-based 
subunit vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse 
vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation, 
three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was 
selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed 
to effectively act against the SARS-CoV-2. Thereafter, the molecular dynamics 
simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order 
to check biological stability and find effective mass production strategy of the 
selected vaccine. This study should contribute to uphold the present efforts of 
the researches to secure a definitive preventative measure against this lethal 
disease.

Before a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 became available, several measures to 
control COVID-19 pandemic are necessary. Analogously, in the absence of an 
available vaccine, Combination HIV Prevention Programmes have consolidated a 
large experience of biomedical, behavioral and structural interventions suitable 
for several epidemiological settings. Adaptation of such experiences can 
organize mid-term and long-term responses to face COVID-19.

Background COVID-19 vaccine prioritization and allocation strategies that 
maximize health benefit through efficient use of limited resources are urgently 
needed. We aimed to provide global, regional, and national estimates of target 
population sizes for COVID-19 vaccination to inform country-specific 
immunization strategies on a global scale. Methods Based on a previous study of 
international allocation for pandemic COVID-19 vaccines, we classified the 
entire world population into eleven priority groups. Information on priority 
groups was derived from a multi-pronged search of official websites, media 
sources and academic journal articles. The sizes of different priority groups 
were projected for 194 countries globally. Results Overall, the size of COVID-19 
vaccine recipient population varied markedly by goals of the vaccination program 
and geography. The general population aged <60 years without any underlying 
condition accounts for the majority of the total population (5.2 billion people, 
68%), followed by 2.3 billion individuals at risk of severe disease, and 46.9 
million essential workers which are critical to maintaining a functional 
society. Differences in the demographic structure, presence of underlying 
conditions, and number of essential workers led to highly variable estimates of 
target populations both at the WHO region and country level. In particular, 
Europe has the highest share of essential workers (6.8%) and the highest share 
of individuals with underlying conditions (37.8%), two priority categories to 
maintain societal functions and reduce severe burden. In contrast, Africa has 
the highest share of healthy adults, school-age individuals, and infants 
(77.6%), which are the key groups to target to reduce community transmission. 
Interpretation The sizeable distribution of target groups on a country and 
regional bases underlines the importance of equitable and efficient vaccine 
prioritization and allocation globally. The direct and indirect benefits of 
COVID-19 vaccination should be balanced by considering local differences in 
demography and health.

The novel, highly contagious coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 spreads rapidly throughout 
the world, leading to a deadly pandemic of a predominantly respiratory illness 
called COVID-19. Safe and effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are urgently 
needed. However, emerging immunological observations show hallmarks of 
significant immunopathological characteristics and dysfunctional immune 
responses in patients with COVID-19. Combined with existing knowledge about 
immune responses to other closely related and highly pathogenic coronaviruses, 
this could forebode significant challenges for vaccine development, including 
the risk of vaccine failure. Animal data from earlier coronavirus vaccine 
efforts indicate that elderly people, most at risk from severe COVID-19 disease, 
could be especially at risk from immunopathologic responses to novel coronavirus 
vaccines. Bacterial "new old friends" such as Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or 
Mycobacterium obuense have the ability to elevate basal systemic levels of type 
1 cytokines and immune cells, correlating with increased protection against 
diverse and unrelated infectious agents, called "trained immunity." Here we 
describe dysfunctional immune responses induced by coronaviruses, representing 
potentially difficult to overcome obstacles to safe, effective vaccine 
development for COVID-19, and outline how trained immunity could help protect 
high risk populations through immunomodulation with BCG and other "new old 
friends."

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revealed major shortcomings 
in our ability to mitigate transmission of infectious viral disease and provide 
treatment to patients, resulting in a public health crisis. Within months of the 
first reported case in China, the virus has spread worldwide at an unprecedented 
rate. COVID-19 illustrates that the biomaterials community was engaged in 
significant research efforts against bacteria and fungi with relatively little 
effort devoted to viruses. Accordingly, biomaterials scientists and engineers 
will have to participate in multidisciplinary antiviral research over the coming 
years. Although tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have historically 
dominated the field of biomaterials, current research holds promise for 
providing transformative solutions to viral outbreaks. To facilitate 
collaboration, it is imperative to establish a mutual language and adequate 
understanding between clinicians, industry partners, and research scientists. In 
this article, clinical perspectives are shared to clearly define emerging 
healthcare needs that can be met by biomaterials solutions. Strategies and 
opportunities for novel biomaterials intervention spanning diagnostics, 
treatment strategies, vaccines, and virus-deactivating surface coatings are 
discussed. Ultimately this review serves as a call for the biomaterials 
community to become a leading contributor to the prevention and management of 
the current and future viral outbreaks.

A vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 might represent the most promising approach to halt 
durably the current COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that anti-CD20 therapy may 
jeopardise the efficacy of such a vaccine. This is regrettable because patients 
receiving anti-CD20 therapy (i.e. those with haematologic malignancies or 
autoimmune disorders) are particularly at risk of severe COVID-19 and, as such, 
are the most in need of a vaccine. Here, we review the reasons why anti-CD20 
therapy may abrogate or diminish the efficacy of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 
and we draw physicians' attention towards this potential risk so that it can be 
considered when evaluating the risk/benefit ratio of anti-CD20 therapy during 
the current pandemic.

The world is currently facing an unprecedented global pandemic caused by Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Predicting the next 
source of the pandemic can be very challenging. As vaccination is the best way 
to prevent an infectious disease, the development of an effective vaccine 
against SARS-CoV-2 can not only reduce the morbidity and mortality associated 
with it, but can also lessen the economic impact. As the traditional method of 
vaccine development takes many years for a vaccine to be available to the 
society, the vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 should be speeded up using a 
pandemic approach with fast-track approvals from the regulatory authorities. 
Various challenges associated with developing a vaccine during the pandemic such 
as technological hurdles, clinical development pathways, regulatory issues, and 
support from global funding agencies are expressed here.

Global fatalities related to COVID-19 are expected to be high in 2020-2021. 
Developing and delivering a vaccine may be the most likely way to end the 
pandemic. If it were possible to shorten this development time by weeks or 
months, this may have a significant effect on reducing deaths. Phase II and 
phase III trials could take less long to conduct if they used human challenge 
methods-that is, deliberately infecting participants with COVID-19 following 
inoculation. This article analyses arguments for and against such methods and 
provides suggested broad guidelines for regulators, researchers and ethics 
committees when considering these matters. It concludes that it may be possible 
to maintain current ethical standards yet still permit human challenge trials in 
a context where delay is critical. The implications are that regulators and 
researchers need to work together now to design robust but short trials and 
streamline ethics approval processes so that they are in place when applications 
for trials are made.

INTRODUCTION: The world is currently fighting a COVID-19 pandemic, perhaps the 
most disruptive infectious disease outbreak since the 1918 Spanish influenza. 
Governments have taken drastic measures to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and 
the development of safe and efficacious vaccine candidates is being accelerated. 
The possibility of vaccine-mediated disease enhancement with coronavirus 
vaccines has been flagged as a potential safety concern, and, despite the urgent 
need, should be thoroughly assessed as vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are being 
tested.
AREA COVERED: We review the in vivo evidence suggesting a theoretical risk of 
disease enhancement after vaccination with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccine 
candidates. We also identify knowledge gaps that need to be filled to maximize 
the chance of developing a safe vaccine and minimize the risk of encountering 
disease enhancement in vaccinated individuals after exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
EXPERT OPINION: We compile and propose avenues to investigate the risk of 
vaccine-mediated disease enhancement both during pre-clinical and early clinical 
development. While the pressing need for a vaccine against COVID-19 (and future 
epidemic coronaviruses) cannot be ignored, we advocate to keep safety at the 
center of the debate. Protecting individuals with effective and safe vaccines 
should be a priority, even during extraordinary times like the COVID-19 
pandemic.

IMPORTANCE: The development of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine has 
progressed at unprecedented speed. Widespread public uptake of the vaccine is 
crucial to stem the pandemic.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the factors associated with survey participants' 
self-reported likelihood of selecting and receiving a hypothetical COVID-19 
vaccine.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A survey study of a nonprobability 
convenience sample of 2000 recruited participants including a choice-based 
conjoint analysis was conducted to estimate respondents' probability of choosing 
a vaccine and willingness to receive vaccination. Participants were asked to 
evaluate their willingness to receive each hypothetical vaccine individually. 
The survey presented respondents with 5 choice tasks. In each, participants 
evaluated 2 hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines and were asked whether they would 
choose vaccine A, vaccine B, or neither vaccine. Vaccine attributes included 
efficacy, protection duration, major adverse effects, minor adverse effects, US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, national origin of vaccine, 
and endorsement. Levels of each attribute for each vaccine were randomly 
assigned, and attribute order was randomized across participants. Survey data 
were collected on July 9, 2020.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Average marginal component effect sizes and marginal 
means were calculated to estimate the relationship between each vaccine 
attribute level and the probability of the respondent choosing a vaccine and 
self-reported willingness to receive vaccination.
RESULTS: A total of 1971 US adults responded to the survey (median age, 43 
[interquartile range, 30-58] years); 999 (51%) were women, 1432 (73%) White, 277 
(14%) were Black, and 190 (10%) were Latinx. An increase in efficacy from 50% to 
70% was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 
0.07; 95% CI, 0.06-0.09), and an increase from 50% to 90% was associated with a 
higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.15-0.18). 
An increase in protection duration from 1 to 5 years was associated with a 
higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.05 95% CI, 0.04-0.07). 
A decrease in the incidence of major adverse effects from 1 in 10 000 to 1 in 
1 000 000 was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine 
(coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.05-0.08). An FDA emergency use authorization was 
associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, -0.03; 
95% CI, -0.04 to -0.01) compared with full FDA approval. A vaccine that 
originated from a non-US country was associated with a lower probability of 
choosing a vaccine (China: -0.13 [95% CI, -0.15 to -0.11]; UK: -0.04 [95% CI, 
-0.06 to -0.02]). Endorsements from the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (coefficient, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.07-0.11) and the World Health 
Organization (coefficient, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.04-0.08), compared with an 
endorsement from President Trump were associated with higher probabilities of 
choosing a vaccine. Analyses of participants' willingness to receive each 
vaccine when assessed individually yielded similar results. An increase in 
efficacy from 50% to 90% was associated with a 10% higher marginal mean 
willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.51 to 0.61). A reduction in the 
incidence of major side effects was associated with a 4% higher marginal mean 
willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.54 to 0.58). A vaccine originating in 
China was associated with a 10% lower willingness to receive a vaccine vs one 
developed in the US (from 0.60 to 0.50) Endorsements from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization were associated 
with increases in willingness to receive a vaccine (7% and 6%, respectively) 
from a baseline endorsement by President Trump (from 0.52 to 0.59 and from 0.52 
to 0.58, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of US adults, vaccine-related 
attributes and political characteristics were associated with self-reported 
preferences for choosing a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and self-reported 
willingness to receive vaccination. These results may help inform public health 
campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes 
available.

The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
has elicited an equally rapid response aiming to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. 
These efforts are encouraging; however, comprehensive efficacy and safety 
evaluations are essential in the development of a vaccine, and we can learn from 
previous vaccine development campaigns. In this Perspective, we summarize 
examples of vaccine-associated disease enhancement in the history of developing 
vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus, dengue virus, SARS-CoV and Middle 
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which highlight the importance of a 
robust safety and efficacy profile, and present recommendations for preclinical 
and clinical evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine candidates as well as for vaccine 
design and optimization.

Herein, we report that a recombinant fusion protein, containing a 457 amino acid 
SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD, residues 319-541) and a mouse IgG1 Fc 
domain, could induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies and stimulate humoral 
and cellular immunity in mice. The antibodies also effectively suppressed 
SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to soluble ACE2, indicating that RBD-mFc may be further 
developed as a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was the result of the 
rapid transmission of a highly pathogenic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), for which there is no efficacious vaccine 
or therapeutic. Toward the development of a vaccine, here we expressed and 
evaluated as potential candidates four versions of the spike (S) protein using 
an insect cell expression system: receptor binding domain (RBD), S1 subunit, the 
wild-type S ectodomain (S-WT), and the prefusion trimer-stabilized form (S-2P). 
We showed that RBD appears as a monomer in solution, whereas S1, S-WT, and S-2P 
associate as homotrimers with substantial glycosylation. Cryo-electron 
microscopy analyses suggested that S-2P assumes an identical trimer conformation 
as the similarly engineered S protein expressed in 293 mammalian cells but with 
reduced glycosylation. Overall, the four proteins confer excellent antigenicity 
with convalescent COVID-19 patient sera in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA), yet show distinct reactivities in immunoblotting. RBD, S-WT and S-2P, 
but not S1, induce high neutralization titres (>3-log) in mice after a 
three-round immunization regimen. The high immunogenicity of S-2P could be 
maintained at the lowest dose (1 μg) with the inclusion of an aluminium 
adjuvant. Higher doses (20 μg) of S-2P can elicit high neutralization titres in 
non-human primates that exceed 40-times the mean titres measured in convalescent 
COVID-19 subjects. Our results suggest that the prefusion trimer-stabilized 
SARS-CoV-2 S-protein from insect cells may offer a potential candidate strategy 
for the development of a recombinant COVID-19 vaccine.

SARS-CoV-2 is the deadly virus behind COVID-19, the disease that went on to 
ravage the world and caused the biggest pandemic 21st century has witnessed so 
far. On the face of ongoing death and destruction, the urgent need for the 
discovery of a vaccine against the virus is paramount. This study resorted to 
the emerging discipline of immunoinformatics in order to design a multi-epitope 
mRNA vaccine against the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Various 
immunoinformatics tools were utilized to predict T and B lymphocyte epitopes. 
The epitopes were channeled through a filtering pipeline comprised of 
antigenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, and cytokine inducibility evaluation with 
the goal of selecting epitopes capable of generating both T and B cell-mediated 
immune responses. Molecular docking simulation between the epitopes and their 
corresponding MHC molecules was carried out. 13 epitopes, a highly immunogenic 
adjuvant, elements for proper sub-cellular trafficking, a secretion booster, and 
appropriate linkers were combined for constructing the vaccine. The vaccine was 
found to be antigenic, almost neutral at physiological pH, non-toxic, 
non-allergenic, capable of generating a robust immune response and had a decent 
worldwide population coverage. Based on these parameters, this design can be 
considered a promising choice for a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

The end of 2019 marked the start of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic from 
China, which went on to envelope more than 190 countries and territories across 
the globe. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from a 
group of betacoronaviruses, is responsible for COVID-19. The virulent factors 
include the presence of envelope and spike proteins having receptor bonding 
domains (RBD). Clinical manifestations can range from mild respiratory 
infections to fatal outcomes. The viability of virus ranges from 3 to 72 hours. 
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the diagnostic test of choice in this 
pandemic situation. Due to the absence of specific antivirals and vaccine, 
adoption of preventive option can help to combat the specific life-threatening 
outcomes.

In late December 2019, a group of patients was observed with pneumonia-like 
symptoms that were linked with a wet market in Wuhan, China. The patients were 
found to have a novel coronavirus genetically related to a bat coronavirus that 
was termed SARS-CoV-2. The virus gradually spread worldwide and was declared a 
pandemic by WHO. Scientists have started trials on potential preventive and 
treatment options. Currently, there is no specific approved treatment for 
SARS-CoV-2, and various clinical trials are underway to explore better 
treatments. Some previously approved antiviral and other drugs have shown some 
in vitro activity. Here we summarize the fight against this novel coronavirus 
with particular focus on the different treatment options and clinical trials 
exploring treatment as well as work done toward development of vaccines.

The supply of affordable, high-quality pharmaceuticals to US patients has been 
on a critical path for decades. In and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, this 
critical path has become tortuous. To regain reliability, reshoring of the 
pharmaceutical supply chain to the USA is now a vital national security need. 
Reshoring the pharmaceutical supply with old know-how and outdated technologies 
that cause inherent unpredictability and adverse environmental impact will 
neither provide the security we seek nor will it be competitive and affordable. 
The challenge at hand is complex akin to redesigning systems, including 
corporate and public research and development, manufacturing, regulatory, and 
education ones. The US academic community must be engaged in progressing 
solutions needed to counter emergencies in the COVID-19 pandemic and in building 
new methods to reshore the pharmaceutical supply chain beyond the pandemic.

Development of an effective vaccine requires a long and complicated process. 
Preclinical studies and phase Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Ⅲ clinical trials mainly focused on the 
assessment of the vaccine's safety (tolerability), immunogenicity and efficacy 
before license. After license, it is necessary to further evaluate the actual 
effectiveness and safety in the general population through phase Ⅳ clinical 
trials and optimize the immunization strategies with the disease's epidemiology 
data. In this special issue, published several articles, which reported the main 
results of pre-license clinical trials and post-marketing evaluation of various 
vaccines, it was extremely useful to support vaccine licensing and market use. 
We encourage the continuous clinical studies and post-marketing evaluation of 
vaccines, including the novel corona virus-19 vaccines, to provide technical 
support for the population use, under the situation of COVID-19 pandemic.

Coronaviruses recently returned with a new one, SARS-CoV-2, related to a 
potentially severe respiratory disease-called the coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19). Research shows that the SARS-CoV-2 can be clustered with the Bat 
SARS-like coronavirus. Bats possess an additional, innate ability for antiviral 
defense, and, on the other hand, the potential to go hand-in-hand with the virus 
to generate variability. Besides the high potential of the novel coronavirus in 
compromising the respiratory system, its rapid transmission and ability to 
engage many hosts in severe forms of infections or immunopathological 
complications make it a tough opponent for the immune system. The interactions 
between SARS-CoV2 and the host immune system result in unleashing tremendous 
amounts of cytokines, and these cytokines make a storm that would determine the 
outcome (recovery or death) of the lungs of the patient.

In the last decades, a number of infectious viruses have emerged from wildlife 
or re-emerged, generating serious threats to the global health and to the 
economy worldwide. Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers, Lassa fever, Dengue 
fever, Yellow fever, West Nile fever, Zika, and Chikungunya vector-borne 
diseases, Swine flu, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East 
respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
are examples of zoonoses that have spread throughout the globe with such a 
significant impact on public health that the scientific community has been 
called for a rapid intervention in preventing and treating emerging infections. 
Vaccination is probably the most effective tool in helping the immune system to 
activate protective responses against pathogens, reducing morbidity and 
mortality, as proven by historical records. Under health emergency conditions, 
new and alternative approaches in vaccine design and development are imperative 
for a rapid and massive vaccination coverage, to manage a disease outbreak and 
curtail the epidemic spread. This review gives an update on the current 
vaccination strategies for some of the emerging/re-emerging viruses, and 
discusses challenges and hurdles to overcome for developing efficacious vaccines 
against future pathogens.

As the transmission of novel corona virus (COVID-19) increases rapidly, the 
whole world adopted the curfew/lockdown activity with restriction of human 
mobility. The imposition of quarantine stopped all the commercial activity that 
greatly affects the various important environmental parameters which directly 
connected to human health. As all the types of social, economic, industrial and 
urbanization activity suddenly shut off, nature takes the advantages and showed 
improvement in the quality of air, cleaner rivers, less noise pollution, 
undisturbed and calm wildlife. This research aims to discuss the COVID-19 effect 
on the global environment. The outcome of this research says that "Although 
coronavirus vaccine is not available coronavirus itself is earth's vaccine and 
us humans are the virus".

Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) vaccines are among the most advanced vaccines for 
COVID-19 under development. The Brighton Collaboration Viral Vector Vaccines 
Safety Working Group (V3SWG) has prepared a standardized template to describe 
the key considerations for the benefit-risk assessment of nucleic acid vaccines. 
This will facilitate the assessment by key stakeholders of potential safety 
issues and understanding of overall benefit-risk. The structured assessment 
provided by the template can also help improve communication and public 
acceptance of licensed nucleic acid vaccines.

The third meeting of WHO's Product Development for Vaccines Advisory Committee 
(PDVAC) was held in June 2016, with a remit to revisit the pathogen areas for 
which significant progress has occurred since recommendations from the 2015 
meeting, as well as to consider new advances in the development of vaccines 
against other pathogens. Since the previous meeting, significant progress has 
been made with regulatory approvals of the first malaria and dengue vaccines, 
and the first phase III trials of a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine 
candidate has started in the elderly and pregnant women. In addition, PDVAC has 
also supported vaccine development efforts against important emerging pathogens, 
including Middle Eastern Coronavirus (MERS CoV) and Zika virus. Trials of HIV 
and tuberculosis vaccine candidates are steadily progressing towards pivotal 
data points, and the leading norovirus vaccine candidate has entered a phase IIb 
efficacy study. WHO's Immunization, Vaccine and Biologicals (IVB) department is 
actively working in several pathogen areas on the recommendation of PDVAC, as 
well as continuing horizon scanning for advances in the development of vaccines 
that may benefit low and middle income countries (LMICs), such as the recent 
licensure of the enterovirus 71 (EV71) vaccine in China. Following on from 
discussions with WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on 
Immunization, PDVAC will also look beyond licensure and consider data needs for 
vaccine recommendation and implementation to reduce the delay between vaccine 
approval and vaccine impact.

The emergence of the novel ß-coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global pandemic of coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19). Clinical studies have documented that potentially 
severe neurological symptoms are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby 
suggesting direct CNS penetration by the virus. Prior studies have demonstrated 
that the destructive neurological effects of rabies virus (RABV) infections are 
mediated by CNS transport of the virus tightly bound to the nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). By comparison, it has been hypothesized that a 
similar mechanism exists to explain the multiple neurological effects of 
SARS-CoV-2 via binding to peripheral nAChRs followed by orthograde or retrograde 
transport into the CNS. Genetic engineering of the RABV has been employed to 
generate novel vaccines consisting of non-replicating RABV particles expressing 
chimeric capsid proteins containing human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), 
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), Ebolavirus, and hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) sequences. Accordingly, we present a critical discussion that integrates 
lessons learned from prior RABV research and vaccine development into a working 
model of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that selectively targets and neutralizes CNS 
penetration of a tightly bound viral nAChR complex.

Human challenge trials to test the efficacy of vaccine candidates against 
SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus behind Covid-19, could save considerable time 
and many lives. But they may initially seem unethical because they expose 
healthy volunteers to a live virus that is killing many people and for which no 
cure exists. This article argues that this is not the correct test of their 
ethics. The correct test is comparative. And in the special circumstances of the 
Covid-19 pandemic, human challenge trials meet the correct test better than 
standard efficacy testing would.

SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate in the human population: an opinion from

At the population level, the virus-host relationship is not set up to end with 
the complete elimination of either or both. Pathogen-resistant individuals will 
always remain in the host population. In turn, the virus can never completely 
eliminate the host population, because evolutionarily such an event is a dead 
end for the virus as an obligate intracellular parasite. A certain existential 
balance exists in the virus-host relationship. Against this backdrop, viral 
epidemics and pandemics only become manifest and egregious to human beings when 
tens and hundreds of thousands of people die and the question emerges what 
caused the high mortality peaks on the death chart. The answer seems clear; the 
emerging strain of the virus is new to the host population, and new mutations of 
the virus and natural selection will lead to a survival of only genetically 
resistant individuals in a host population. The dangers inherent to a novel 
virus are due to new features generally inthe molecular structure of proteins, 
which enable the virus to infect the cells of the host organism more 
intensively, dramatically challenging host immunity, and thus be transmitted 
more readily in the host population. In this article, we will concentrate on the 
facts currently available about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2), which has caused COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and 
try to predict its development and consequences based on the virus-host 
relationship. In fact, only two scenarios will occur simultaneously in the very 
near future: people who are genetically resistant to the virus will get sick, 
recover, and develop immunity, while people who are sensitive to the virus will 
need drugs and vaccines, which will have to be researched and developed if they 
are to recover. If the pandemic does not stop, in a few decades it is 
anticipated that SARS-CoV-2 will become as safe as the four non-severe acute 
respiratory syndrome human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and 
HCoV-229E) currently circulating but causing low mortality in the human 
population.

The public health crisis caused by COVID-19 disease has bring again to the 
public arena the old debate of the role in decision-making process of politics 
and science. In this paper we analyze, in the context of the current pandemics, 
how politics has left a stellar role for science, either because science has 
anticipated in its proposals to politics, or because politics has opted for it 
as a premeditated strategy. The references to the opinion of scientists as a 
decision-making criterion or, furthermore, their presence as true spokesmen for 
authority have been so frequent. This means rediscovering science and health as 
instruments of power, in terms that remind us of what Foucault denounced almost 
fifty years ago with his Biopolitics.

The recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has now spread worldwide and caused 
more than 51,000 deaths, by April 2nd 2020. As predicted, there are several 
obstacles for medical and governmental authorities to efficiently manage this 
respiratory illness. In spite of appropriated supplies, most hospitals are 
suffering from a scarcity of free beds, protective masks, sanitizing liquids and 
even ECMO machines for patients with severe cases. Defeating this pandemic is 
impossible without united and coordinated international attempts shaped by all 
countries of the world. We believe that an international scaled-determination is 
required to diminish the complex impacts of pandemic. The most important 
priorities are supposed to be i) The development of potential vaccine candidates 
to provide protection and interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, ii) To 
ensure enough supplies for hospitals and their homogeneous distribution among 
the countries with the worst number of severe cases, iii) There is a need for 
more studies to identify potential treatments that are effective for the control 
of this viral infection and iv) It is imperative to provide easy access to 
diagnostic kits for all countries affected by this pandemic. In the light of 
these suggestions, it would be recommendable to at least temporarily abandon the 
political checkouts in both national and international levels; therefore, all 
partners will be potentially able to efficiently enforce their strategies for 
the elimination of this unique threat to the human populations.

In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-vaccine sentiments have been on the 
rise, with a recent seminal study on the development of anti-vaccine views in 
social media even making its way into Nature Communications. Yet, with the 
current scientific consensus being in overwhelming agreement over the safety and 
efficacy of vaccines, many scientists lose their grasp on the fears, concerns, 
and arguments that the opposition may hold. This paper discusses and evaluates 
vaccine-hesitant individuals on a socioeconomic, historical, and philosophical 
landscape. It also provides an analysis of common argumentative patterns and the 
psychological impact that these arguments may have on undecided individuals. The 
discussion also explores why anti-vaccine sentiments are on the rise, and how 
members of the scientific and medical community require a more structured 
approach to communicating key arguments. This is particularly important if 
vaccination rates and herd immunity are to be sustained. No longer is it 
sufficient to win arguments based on a factual and scientific basis, but rather 
scientists and medical practitioners have to focus on conveying confidence and 
reassurance on both an informative and emotional level to those with doubts and 
fears.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by 
the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a 
global health threat associated with major socioeconomic disruptions. 
Understanding on the transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for 
optimizing preventive strategies.
RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted efficiently between persons 
through respiratory droplets and direct and indirect contact. The significance 
of airborne droplet nuclei in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community setting 
is less clear. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and live viral particles may also be detected in 
other bodily fluids. Outbreaks have been reported in families, nursing homes, 
markets, restaurants, churches, shipping vessels, gyms, and healthcare 
facilities. Nonpharmaceutical preventive measures at both the community and 
individual levels are essential for reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
SUMMARY: Because well tolerated and effective vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are 
unlikely to be widely available in the near future, there is an urgent need for 
finding other measures to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. With 
better understanding of its transmission characteristics, practical 
nonpharmaceutical preventive measures remain essential to reduce SARS-CoV-2 
transmission and its associated health and socioeconomic burdens.

Distrust in scientific expertise1-14 is dangerous. Opposition to vaccination 
with a future vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, for 
example, could amplify outbreaks2-4, as happened for measles in 20195,6. 
Homemade remedies7,8 and falsehoods are being shared widely on the Internet, as 
well as dismissals of expert advice9-11. There is a lack of understanding about 
how this distrust evolves at the system level13,14. Here we provide a map of the 
contention surrounding vaccines that has emerged from the global pool of around 
three billion Facebook users. Its core reveals a multi-sided landscape of 
unprecedented intricacy that involves nearly 100 million individuals partitioned 
into highly dynamic, interconnected clusters across cities, countries, 
continents and languages. Although smaller in overall size, anti-vaccination 
clusters manage to become highly entangled with undecided clusters in the main 
online network, whereas pro-vaccination clusters are more peripheral. Our 
theoretical framework reproduces the recent explosive growth in anti-vaccination 
views, and predicts that these views will dominate in a decade. Insights 
provided by this framework can inform new policies and approaches to interrupt 
this shift to negative views. Our results challenge the conventional thinking 
about undecided individuals in issues of contention surrounding health, shed 
light on other issues of contention such as climate change11, and highlight the 
key role of network cluster dynamics in multi-species ecologies15.

Since the first appearance of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 
2 (SARS- CoV-2) in China on December 2019, the world has now witnessed the 
emergence of the SARS- CoV-2 outbreak. Therefore, due to the high 
transmissibility rate of virus, there is an urgent need to design and develop 
vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to prevent more cases affected by the virus. In this 
study, a computational approach is proposed for vaccine design against the 
envelope (E) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which contains a conserved sequence feature. 
First, we sought to gain potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes for vaccine 
designing against SARS-CoV-2. Second, we attempted to develop a multi-epitope 
vaccine. Immune targeting of such epitopes could theoretically provide defense 
against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we evaluated the affinity of the vaccine to major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to stimulate the immune system 
response to this vaccine. We also identified a collection of B-cell and T-cell 
epitopes derived from E proteins that correspond identically to SARS-CoV-2 E 
proteins. The in-silico design of our potential vaccine against E protein of 
SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated a high affinity to MHC molecules, and it can be a 
candidate to make a protection against this pandemic event.

A number of papers have appeared recently arguing for the conclusion that it is 
ethically acceptable to infect healthy volunteers with severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 as part of research projects aimed at developing COVID-19 
vaccines or treatments. This position has also been endorsed in a statement by a 
working group for the WHO. The papers generally argue that controlled human 
infection (CHI) is ethically acceptable if (1) the risks to participants are low 
and therefore acceptable, (2) the scientific quality of the research is high, 
(3) the research has high social value, (4) participants give full informed 
consent, and (5) there is fair selection of participants. All five conditions 
are necessary premises in the overall argument that such research is ethically 
acceptable. The arguments concerning risk and informed consent have already been 
critically discussed in the literature. This paper therefore looks specifically 
at the arguments relating to condition 3 'high social value' and condition 5 
'fair selection of participants' and shows that whereas they may be valid, they 
are not sound. It is highly unlikely that the conditions that are necessary for 
ethical CHI trials to take place will be fulfilled. Most, if not all, CHI trials 
will thus be well intentioned but unethical.

The outbreak of COVID-19 across the world has posed unprecedented and global 
challenges on multiple fronts. Most of the vaccine and drug development has 
focused on the spike proteins and viral RNA-polymerases and main protease for 
viral replication. Using the bioinformatics and structural modelling approach, 
we modelled the structure of the envelope (E)-protein of novel SARS-CoV-2. The 
E-protein of this virus shares sequence similarity with that of SARS- CoV-1, and 
is highly conserved in the N-terminus regions. Incidentally, compared to spike 
proteins, E proteins demonstrate lower disparity and mutability among the 
isolated sequences. Using homology modelling, we found that the most favorable 
structure could function as a gated ion channel conducting H+ ions. Combining 
pocket estimation and docking with water, we determined that GLU 8 and ASN 15 in 
the N-terminal region were in close proximity to form H-bonds which was further 
validated by insertion of the E protein in an ERGIC-mimic membrane. 
Additionally, two distinct "core" structures were visible, the hydrophobic core 
and the central core, which may regulate the opening/closing of the channel. We 
propose this as a mechanism of viral ion channeling activity which plays a 
critical role in viral infection and pathogenesis. In addition, it provides a 
structural basis and additional avenues for vaccine development and generating 
therapeutic interventions against the virus.

COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in 16,114,449 cases with 646,641 deaths from the 
217 countries, or territories as on July 27th 2020. Due to multifaceted issues 
and challenges in the implementation of the safety and preventive measures, 
inconsistent coordination between societies-governments and most importantly 
lack of specific vaccine to SARS-CoV-2, the spread of the virus that initially 
emerged at Wuhan is still uprising after taking a heavy toll on human life. In 
the present study, we mapped immunogenic epitopes present on the four structural 
proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and we designed a multi-epitope peptide based vaccine 
that, demonstrated a high immunogenic response with a vast application on 
world's human population. On codon optimization and in-silico cloning, we found 
that candidate vaccine showed high expression in E. coli and immune simulation 
resulted in inducing a high level of both B-cell and T-cell mediated immunity. 
The results predicted that exposure of vaccine by administrating three 
injections significantly subsidized the antigen growth in the system. The 
proposed candidate vaccine found promising by yielding desired results and 
hence, should be validated by practical experimentations for its functioning and 
efficacy to neutralize SARS-CoV-2.

BACKGROUND: An outbreak of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 recently has brought a 
great challenge to public health. Rapid identification of immune epitopes would 
be an efficient way to screen the candidates for vaccine development at the time 
of pandemic. This study aimed to predict the protective epitopes with 
bioinformatics methods and resources for vaccine development.
METHODS: The genome sequence and protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved 
from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. ABCpred 
and BepiPred servers were utilized for sequential B-cell epitope analysis. 
Discontinuous B-cell epitopes were predicted via DiscoTope 2.0 program. IEDB 
server was utilized for HLA-1 and HLA-2 binding peptides computation. Surface 
accessibility, antigenicity, and other important features of forecasted epitopes 
were characterized for immunogen potential evaluation.
RESULTS: A total of 63 sequential B-cell epitopes on spike protein were 
predicted and 4 peptides (Spike315-324, Spike333-338, Spike648-663, 
Spike1064-1079) exhibited high antigenicity score and good surface 
accessibility. Ten residues within spike protein (Gly496, Glu498, Pro499, 
Thr500, Leu1141, Gln1142, Pro1143, Glu1144, Leu1145, Asp1146) are forecasted as 
components of discontinuous B-cell epitopes. The bioinformatics analysis of HLA 
binding peptides within nucleocapsid protein produced 81 and 64 peptides being 
able to bind MHC class I and MHC class II molecules respectively. The peptides 
(Nucleocapsid66-75, Nucleocapsid104-112) were predicted to bind a wide spectrum 
of both HLA-1 and HLA-2 molecules.
CONCLUSIONS: B-cell epitopes on spike protein and T-cell epitopes within 
nucleocapsid protein were identified and recommended for developing a protective 
vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

Vaccination practices in Germany are driven by scientific developments and a 
complex regulatory environment. Some important developments in 2019/20 are 
described here: Work-related vaccination recommendations for measles, rubella, 
and chickenpox have been streamlined and expanded. In addition, measles 
vaccination or documentation of immunity is now mandatory for employment at and 
attendance of many institutions, specifically including day care centers and 
schools. Owing to the shift of pneumococcal serotypes since the introduction of 
conjugate vaccines the US ACIP no longer recommends these for the routine 
administration to healthy persons of older age. Reduced series of 2 or even 1 
dose of an HPV vaccine may be sufficient, however definitive RCT data are not 
yet available. After years of development and clinical studies the first vaccine 
against Ebolavirus disease has been licensed by EMA in November and by FDA in 
December 2019. More than 150 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates are being developed 
with massive financial support, several phase 1/2 trials have started. A 
licensed vaccine may actually be available in 2021 and thus dramatically faster 
compared to any other modern vaccine development.

Several protein vaccine candidates are among the COVID-19 vaccines in 
development. The Brighton Collaboration Viral Vector Vaccines Safety Working 
Group (V3SWG) has prepared a standardized template to describe the key 
considerations for the benefit-risk assessment of protein vaccines. This will 
help key stakeholders to assess potential safety issues and understand the 
benefit-risk of such a vaccine platform. The structured and standardized 
assessment provided by the template would also help contribute to improved 
public acceptance and communication of licensed protein vaccines.

In response to the SARS‑CoV‑2 outbreak, and the resulting COVID‑19 pandemic, a 
global competition to develop an anti‑COVID‑19 vaccine has ensued. The targeted 
time frame for initial vaccine deployment is late 2020. The present article 
examines whether short‑term, mid‑term, and long‑term vaccine safety can be 
achieved under such an accelerated schedule, given the myriad vaccine‑induced 
mechanisms that have demonstrated adverse effects based on previous clinical 
trials and laboratory research. It presents scientific evidence of potential 
pitfalls associated with eliminating critical phase II and III clinical trials, 
and concludes that there is no substitute currently available for long‑term 
human clinical trials to ensure long‑term human safety.

Since the first reports in mid-January of a serious new viral respiratory 
infection, COVID-19, and the identification of SARS-CoV-2 as the cause of this 
disease, researchers work intensely on developing a vaccine that can protect 
individuals against serious disease and that can limit the spread of the virus. 
Vaccine developers are using a range of platform technologies to do this, each 
with advantages and disadvantages. Close to 30 vaccines are now in clinical 
testing. The first results are encouraging, but in order to properly assess the 
merits of the different vaccines, we must wait for the results of phase 3 
trials. The first phase 3 trials have started in July 2020.

With the dramatic background of a newly emerged virus (SARS-CoV-2) spreading 
around the world, Coronavirus and other infectious health threats for the human 
and animal populations were illustrated and debated in excellent presentations 
at the IABS meeting 26-28 of February 2020. Historical evidence of pandemics and 
lessons learned from recent epidemics or epizootics caused by many pathogens 
(e.g., Ebola, Zika, and African Swine Fever viruses) illustrated the overarching 
need for close international cooperation. New and old technologies in vaccine 
development and their use were presented, resulting in a call for greater 
interaction between the human and the veterinary fields in order to leverage the 
expertise and knowledge in both human and animal medicine. The One Health 
concept was also emphasized for eliminating the 59,000 fatal human rabies cases 
annually attributed to unvaccinated dogs. For preventable, infectious diseases 
commonly spreading in the poorer regions of the world, a new regulatory approach 
and governance structure was called for to give access to affordable vaccines. 
Vaccines were touted as one of the most successful health invention ever 
introduced; on a similar level to health improvements due to clean water.

Alarms periodically emerge for viral pneumonia infections due to coronavirus. In 
all cases, these are zoonoses passing the barrier between species and infect 
humans. The legitimate concern of the international community is due to the fact 
that the new identified coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 (previously called 
2019-nCoV), has a quite high mortality rate, around 2%, and a strong ability to 
spread, with an estimated reproduction number higher than 2. Even though all 
countries are doing their utmost to stop the pandemic, the only reliable 
solution to tackle the infection is the rapid development of a vaccine. For this 
purpose, the means of bioinformatics, applied in the context of 
reverse-vaccinology paradigm, can be of fundamental help to select the most 
promising peptides able to trigger an effective immune response. In this short 
report, using the concept of nullomer and introducing a distance from human 
self, we provide a list of peptides that could deserve experimental 
investigation in the view of a potential vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.

The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions of 
people with a large number of deaths across the globe. The existing therapies 
are limited in dealing with SARS-CoV-2 due to the sudden appearance of the 
virus. Therefore, vaccines and antiviral medicines are in desperate need. We 
took immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for 
surface glycoprotein (S), membrane glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N) 
of SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with 
the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. Allergenicity, toxicity, 
physiochemical properties analysis and stability were examined to confirm the 
specificity and selectivity of the epitope candidates. We identified a total of 
five B cell epitopes in RBD of S protein, seven MHC class-I, and 18 MHC class-II 
binding T-cell epitopes from S, M and N protein which showed non-allergenic, 
non-toxic and highly antigenic features and non-mutated in 55,179 SARS-CoV-2 
virus strains until June 25, 2020. The epitopes identified here can be a 
potentially good candidate repertoire for vaccine development.

Update of
    bioRxiv. 2020 May 17;:

We present a combinatorial machine learning method to evaluate and optimize 
peptide vaccine formulations for SARS-CoV-2. Our approach optimizes the 
presentation likelihood of a diverse set of vaccine peptides conditioned on a 
target human-population HLA haplotype distribution and expected epitope drift. 
Our proposed SARS-CoV-2 MHC class I vaccine formulations provide 93.21% 
predicted population coverage with at least five vaccine peptide-HLA average 
hits per person (≥ 1 peptide: 99.91%) with all vaccine peptides perfectly 
conserved across 4,690 geographically sampled SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our proposed 
MHC class II vaccine formulations provide 97.21% predicted coverage with at 
least five vaccine peptide-HLA average hits per person with all peptides having 
an observed mutation probability of ≤ 0.001. We provide an open-source 
implementation of our design methods (OptiVax), vaccine evaluation tool 
(EvalVax), as well as the data used in our design efforts here:

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, is already 
responsible for more than 4.3 million confirmed cases and 295,000 deaths 
worldwide as of May 15, 2020. Ongoing efforts to control the pandemic include 
the development of peptide-based vaccines and diagnostic tests. In these 
approaches, HLA allelic diversity plays a crucial role. Despite its importance, 
current knowledge of HLA allele frequencies in South America is very limited. In 
this study, we have performed a literature review of datasets reporting HLA 
frequencies of South American populations, available in scientific literature 
and/or in the Allele Frequency Net Database. This allowed us to enrich the 
current scenario with more than 12.8 million data points. As a result, we are 
presenting updated HLA allelic frequencies based on country, including 91 
alleles that were previously thought to have frequencies either under 5% or of 
an unknown value. Using alleles with an updated frequency of at least ≥5% in any 
South American country, we predicted epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins using 
NetMHCpan (I and II) and MHC flurry. Then, the best predicted epitopes (class-I 
and -II) were selected based on their binding to South American alleles 
(Coverage Score). Class II predicted epitopes were also filtered based on their 
three-dimensional exposure. We obtained 14 class-I and four class-II candidate 
epitopes with experimental evidence (reported in the Immune Epitope Database and 
Analysis Resource), having good coverage scores for South America. Additionally, 
we are presenting 13 HLA-I and 30 HLA-II novel candidate epitopes without 
experimental evidence, including 16 class-II candidates in highly exposed 
conserved areas of the NTD and RBD regions of the Spike protein. These novel 
candidates have even better coverage scores for South America than those with 
experimental evidence. Finally, we show that recent similar studies presenting 
candidate epitopes also predicted some of our candidates but discarded them in 
the selection process, resulting in candidates with suboptimal coverage for 
South America. In conclusion, the candidate epitopes presented provide valuable 
information for the development of epitope-based strategies against SARS-CoV-2, 
such as peptide vaccines and diagnostic tests. Additionally, the updated HLA 
allelic frequencies provide a better representation of South America and may 
impact different immunogenetic studies.

Deaths from COVID-19 depend on millions of people understanding risk and 
translating this understanding into risk-reduction behaviors. Although numerical 
information about risk is helpful, numbers are surprisingly ambiguous, and there 
are predictable mismatches in risk perception between laypeople and experts. 
Hence, risk communication should convey the qualitative, contextualized meaning 
of risk.

In the United States, immunization recommendations and their associated 
schedules are developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices 
(ACIP). To assist with the translation process and better harmonize the outcomes 
of existing clinical decision support tools, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) created clinical decision support for immunization (CDSi) 
resources for each set of ACIP recommendations. These resources are continually 
updated and refined as new vaccine recommendations and clarifications become 
available and will be available to health information systems for a coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine when one becomes available for use in the United 
States Objectives: To assess awareness of CDSi resources, whether CDSi resources 
were being used by immunization-related health information systems, and 
perceived impact of CDSi resources on stakeholders' work Design: Online surveys 
conducted from 2015-2019 including qualitative and quantitative questions 
Participants: The main and technical contact from each of the 64 CDC-funded 
immunization information system (IIS) awardees, IIS vendors, and electronic 
health record vendors Results: Awareness of at least one resource increased from 
75% of respondents in 2015 to 100% in 2019. Use of at least one CDSi resource 
also increased from 47% in 2015 to 78% in 2019. About 80% or more of users of 
CDSi are somewhat or very highly satisfied with the resources and report a 
somewhat or very positive impact from using them Conclusion: As awareness and 
use of CDSi resources increases, the likelihood that patients receive 
recommended immunizations at the right time will also increase. Rapid and 
precise integration of vaccine recommendations into health information systems 
will be particularly important when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available to help 
facilitate vaccine implementation.

particularly for microorganisms that can spread globally. Good examples are 
pandemics caused by HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and nowadays severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus of coronavirus 
disease (COVID)-19.

SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, which emerged in 
China at the end of 2019, is responsible for a global health crisis resulting in 
the confinement of more than 3 billion people worldwide and the sharp decline of 
the world economy. In this context, a race against the clock is launched in 
order to develop a treatment to stop the pandemic as soon as possible. A study 
published in Nature by the Volker Thiel team reports the development of reverse 
genetics for SARS-CoV-2 allowing them to recreate the virus in just a few weeks. 
The perspectives of this work are very interesting since it will allow the 
genetic manipulation of the virus and thus the development of precious tools 
which will be useful to fight the infection. Even though this approach 
represents a technological leap that will improve our knowledge of the virus, it 
also carries the germ of possible misuse and the creation of the virus for 
malicious purposes. The advantages and disadvantages of recreating SARS-CoV-2 in 
this pandemic period are discussed in this mini-synthesis.

Publisher: TITLE: Une course contre la montre - Création du SARS-CoV-2 en 
laboratoire, un mois après son émergence !
ABSTRACT: Le SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2), qui a 
émergé à la fin de l’année 2019 en République populaire de Chine, est 
responsable d’une crise sanitaire mondiale qui a entraîné le confinement de plus 
de 3 milliards d’individus et l’arrêt brutal de l’économie planétaire. Dans ce 
contexte, une course contre la montre est lancée afin de développer, dans les 
plus brefs délais, un traitement permettant d’enrayer la pandémie. Une étude de 
l’équipe de Volker Thiel, parue dans le journal Nature, rapporte la mise au 
point d’une technique de génétique inverse pour le SARS-CoV-2, leur ayant permis 
de recréer le virus en seulement quelques semaines. Les perspectives de ces 
travaux sont très intéressantes puisqu’elles permettent d’envisager la 
manipulation génétique du virus et ainsi le développement d’outils précieux qui 
seront utiles pour combattre l’infection. Si la technique représente également 
un saut technologique qui permettra d’améliorer nos connaissances sur le virus, 
elle porte aussi en elle le germe d’un possible mésusage et la création d’un 
virus à des fins malveillantes. Les avantages et inconvénients de recréer le 
SARS-CoV-2 dans cette période de pandémie sont discutés dans cet article.

Even though extreme containment and mitigation strategies were implemented by 
numerous governments around the world to slow down the spread of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the number of critically ill 
patients and fatalities keeps rising. This crisis has highlighted the 
socioeconomic disparities of health care systems within and among countries. As 
new CoVID policies and responses are implemented to lessen the impact of the 
virus, it is imperative (1) to consider additional mitigation strategies 
critical for the development of effective countermeasures, (2) to promote 
long-term policies and strict regulations of the trade of wildlife and live 
animal markets, and (3) to advocate for necessary funding and investments in 
global health, specifically for the prevention of and response to natural and 
manmade pandemics. This document considers some of these challenges.

Inactivated viral vaccines have long been used in humans for diseases of global 
health threat and are now among the vaccines for COVID-19 under development. The 
Brighton Collaboration Viral Vector Vaccines Safety Working Group (V3SWG) has 
prepared a standardized template to describe the key considerations for the 
benefit-risk assessment of inactivated viral vaccines. This will help key 
stakeholders to assess potential safety issues and understand the benefit-risk 
of the vaccine platform. The standardized and structured assessment provided by 
the template would also help to contribute to improved communication and support 
public acceptance of licensed inactivated viral vaccines.

Although the development of successful vaccines against coronaviruses may be 
achieved, for some individuals the immune response that they stimulate may prove 
to be insufficient for effective host defence. The principle that a relatively 
strong contact allergen will have an enhancing effect on sensitization compared 
with a less potent contact allergen if they are co-administered, may not, at 
first, appear relevant to this issue. However, this augmentation effect is 
thought to be due to the sharing of common or complementary pathways. Here, we 
briefly consider aspects of the shared and complementary pathways between skin 
sensitization induced by exposure to a contact allergen and the immune response 
to viruses, with particular reference to COVID-19. The relationship leads us to 
explore whether this principle, which we name here as "co-operative immune 
augmentation" may be extended to include viral vaccination. We consider evidence 
that even relatively weak contact allergens, used in vaccines for other 
purposes, can show enhanced sensitization, which is in keeping with a 
co-operative augmentation principle. Finally, we consider how the potent contact 
allergen diphenylcyclopropenone could be employed safely as an enhancer of 
vaccine responses.

SARS-CoV-2 has become a pandemic worldwide; therefore, an effective vaccine is 
urgently needed. Recently, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have emerged as a promising 
platform for vaccination. In this work, the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs 
are systematically engineered in order to enhance protein production. Through a 
comprehensive analysis of endogenous gene expression and de novo design of UTRs, 
the optimal combination of 5' and 3' UTR are identified and termed NASAR, which 
are 5- to 10-fold more efficient than the tested endogenous UTRs. More 
importantly, NASAR mRNAs delivered by lipid-derived TT3 nanoparticles trigger a 
dramatic expression of potential SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The antigen-specific 
antibodies induced by TT3-nanoparticles and NASAR mRNAs are over two orders of 
magnitude more than that induced by the FDA-approved lipid nanoparticle material 
MC3 in vaccinated mice. These NASAR mRNAs merit further development as 
alternative SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
and subsequent containment procedures have impacted the world as never seen 
before. Therefore, there is considerable curiosity about the genome evolution 
related to the origin, transmission and vaccine impact of this virus. We have 
analysed genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Indian patients to gain an 
in-depth understanding of genomic evolution and transmission in India. 
Phylogenetic analysis and mutation profiling revealed major lineages being 
evolved by characteristic mutations. As the mutation frequency in spike protein 
is comparatively lesser, the candidate vaccines expected to have wide coverage 
worldwide including India.

In recent years, several cases of measles have appeared on the campuses of the 
University of Lausanne (UNIL) and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in 
Lausanne (EPFL). In response to this, several medical students have mobilized in 
collaboration with various cantonal authorities in order to set up a free 
measles, mumps and rubella vaccination campaign on the UNIL/EPFL campuses, in 
2019. This first edition was a success and will be repeated in the future. Such 
an approach having shown its feasibility, it could be applied to other public 
health issues. The involvement of medical students could thus be extremely 
valuable if a generalized vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 were to take place.

The spread of the novel virus SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was explosive, 
with cases first identified in December 2019, and >22 million people infected 
and >775,000 deaths as of August 2020. SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory 
disease in humans leading to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The 
development of effective clinical interventions, such as antivirals and vaccines 
that can limit or even prevent the burden and spread of SARS-CoV-2, is a global 
health priority. Testing of leading antivirals, monoclonal antibody therapies 
and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will require robust animal and cell models of 
viral pathogenesis. In this Special Article, we discuss the cell-based and 
animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis that have been described 
as of August 2020. We also outline the outstanding questions for which 
researchers can leverage animal and cell-based models to improve our 
understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and protective immunity. Taken 
together, the refinement of models of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be critical to 
guide the development of therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to end the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

The emergence and fast global spread of COVID-19 has presented one of the 
greatest public health challenges in modern times with no proven cure or 
vaccine. Africa is still early in this epidemic, therefore the extent of disease 
severity is not yet clear. We used a mathematical model to fit to the observed 
cases of COVID-19 in South Africa to estimate the basic reproductive number and 
critical vaccination coverage to control the disease for different hypothetical 
vaccine efficacy scenarios. We also estimated the percentage reduction in 
effective contacts due to the social distancing measures implemented. Early 
model estimates show that COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa had a basic 
reproductive number of 2.95 (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.83-3.33). A vaccine 
with 70% efficacy had the capacity to contain COVID-19 outbreak but at very 
higher vaccination coverage 94.44% (95% Crl 92.44-99.92%) with a vaccine of 100% 
efficacy requiring 66.10% (95% Crl 64.72-69.95%) coverage. Social distancing 
measures put in place have so far reduced the number of social contacts by 
80.31% (95% Crl 79.76-80.85%). These findings suggest that a highly efficacious 
vaccine would have been required to contain COVID-19 in South Africa. Therefore, 
the current social distancing measures to reduce contacts will remain key in 
controlling the infection in the absence of vaccines and other therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: A new endemic disease has spread across Wuhan City, China, in 
December 2019. Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a 
novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In late 
January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a "public-health emergency of 
international concern" due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease 
worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this 
emerging infection; thus, the objective of this study is to design a 
multiepitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using an immunoinformatics 
approach.
METHOD: Several techniques facilitating the combination of the immunoinformatics 
approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the 
potential peptides for designing the T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine using 
the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target.
RESULTS: Extensive mutations, insertion, and deletion were discovered with 
comparative sequencing in the COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides 
binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates 
for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 
using the envelope protein as an immunogenic target. Nevertheless, the proposed 
vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety 
and immunogenic profile to help stop this epidemic before it leads to 
devastating global outbreaks.

This paper concerns study of the genome of the Wuhan Seafood Market isolate 
believed to represent the causative agent of the disease COVID-19. This is to 
find a short section or sections of viral protein sequence suitable for 
preliminary design proposal for a peptide synthetic vaccine and a peptidomimetic 
therapeutic, and to explore some design possibilities. The project was 
originally directed towards a use case for the Q-UEL language and its 
implementation in a knowledge management and automated inference system for 
medicine called the BioIngine, but focus here remains mostly on the virus 
itself. However, using Q-UEL systems to access relevant and emerging literature, 
and to interact with standard publically available bioinformatics tools on the 
Internet, did help quickly identify sequences of amino acids that are well 
conserved across many coronaviruses including 2019-nCoV. KRSFIEDLLFNKV was found 
to be particularly well conserved in this study and corresponds to the region 
around one of the known cleavage sites of the SARS virus that are believed to be 
required for virus activation for cell entry. This sequence motif and 
surrounding variations formed the basis for proposing a specific synthetic 
vaccine epitope and peptidomimetic agent. The work can, nonetheless, be 
described in traditional bioinformatics terms, and readily reproduced by others, 
albeit with the caveat that new data and research into 2019-nCoV is emerging and 
evolving at an explosive pace. Preliminary studies using molecular modeling and 
docking, and in that context the potential value of certain known herbal 
extracts, are also described.

An outbreak of a new coronavirus originating from Wuhan (China), responsible for 
a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), called SARS-CoV-2, is causing a 
pandemic disease called CoViD-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19), although strict 
containment measures and restrictions on individual travel have been taken 
everywhere to hinder the spread of the virus. The clinical spectrum of this 
infection includes, in order of lesser to greater severity, asymptomatic 
viremia, paucisymptomatic forms, clinical conditions characterized by 
respiratory failure that needs mechanical ventilation and support in an 
intensive care unit, systemic manifestations of infection, septic shock, and 
multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. There is currently no vaccine to prevent 
CoViD-19, but the international scientific community is intensely focused on 
finding a vaccine that will prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In the meanwhile, 
to prevent hospitals from risking collapse, it is crucial to stratify patients 
at high risk of poor lung progression, to find effective monitoring strategies, 
even at home, for the positive patients and/or those highly at risk of 
positivity of CoViD-19. Starting from the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in 
the development of this infection up to the clinical characteristics of the 
infected patients, in this review we tried to focus on the crucial points of the 
infection in combination with the appropriateness of the medical intervention. 
We aim to offer indications of therapeutic intervention that are timely and, as 
far as possible, effective, targeted to the individual patient in relation to 
age, clinical condition and comorbidities. An early diagnosis associated with an 
appropriate therapeutic action in the initial stages of the disease can reduce 
the progression of CoViD-19 towards interstitial pneumonia, thus interfering 
with the number of transfers to intensive care and lethality of the pandemic in 
progress.

BACKGROUND: Health-seeking behaviors change during pandemics and may increase 
with regard to illnesses with symptoms similar to the pandemic. The global 
reaction to COVID-19 may drive interest in vaccines for other diseases.
OBJECTIVES: Our study investigated the correlation between global online 
interest in COVID-19 and interest in CDC-recommended routine vaccines.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, MEASUREMENTS: This infodemiology study used Google Trends data 
to quantify worldwide interest in COVID-19 and CDC-recommended vaccines using 
the unit search volume index (SVI), which estimates volume of online search 
activity relative to highest volume of searches within a specified period. SVIs 
from December 30, 2019 to March 30, 2020 were collected for "coronavirus 
(Virus)" and compared with SVIs of search terms related to CDC-recommended adult 
vaccines. To account for seasonal variation, we compared SVIs from December 30, 
2019 to March 30, 2020 with SVIs from the same months in 2015 to 2019. We 
performed country-level analyses in ten COVID-19 hotspots and ten countries with 
low disease burden.
RESULTS: There were significant positive correlations between SVIs for 
"coronavirus (Virus)" and search terms for pneumococcal (R = 0.89, p < 0.0001) 
and influenza vaccines (R = 0.93, p < 0.0001) in 2020, which were greater than 
SVIs for the same terms in 2015-2019 (p = 0.005, p < 0.0001, respectively). 
Eight in ten COVID-19 hotspots demonstrated significant positive correlations 
between SVIs for coronavirus and search terms for pneumococcal and influenza 
vaccines.
LIMITATIONS: SVIs estimate relative changes in online interest and do not 
represent the interest of people with no Internet access.
CONCLUSION: A peak in worldwide interest in pneumococcal and influenza vaccines 
coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic in February and March 2020. Trends are 
likely not seasonal in origin and may be driven by COVID-19 hotspots. Global 
events may change public perception about the importance of vaccines. Our 
findings may herald higher demand for pneumonia and influenza vaccines in the 
upcoming season.

To control and prevent the current COVID-19 pandemic, the development of novel 
vaccines is an emergent issue. In addition, we need to develop tools that can 
measure/monitor T-cell and B-cell responses to know how our immune system is 
responding to this deleterious virus. However, little information is currently 
available about the immune target epitopes of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to 
induce host immune responses. Through a comprehensive bioinformatic screening of 
potential epitopes derived from the SARS-CoV-2 sequences for HLAs commonly 
present in the Japanese population, we identified 2013 and 1399 possible peptide 
epitopes that are likely to have the high affinity (<0.5%- and 2%-rank, 
respectively) to HLA class I and II molecules, respectively, that may induce 
CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses. These epitopes distributed across the structural 
(spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins) and the nonstructural 
proteins (proteins corresponding to six open reading frames); however, we found 
several regions where high-affinity epitopes were significantly enriched. By 
comparing the sequences of these predicted T cell epitopes to the other 
coronaviruses, we identified 781 HLA-class I and 418 HLA-class II epitopes that 
have high homologies to SARS-CoV. To further select commonly-available epitopes 
that would be applicable to larger populations, we calculated population 
coverages based on the allele frequencies of HLA molecules, and found 2 
HLA-class I epitopes covering 83.8% of the Japanese population. The findings in 
the current study provide us valuable information to design widely-available 
vaccine epitopes against SARS-CoV-2 and also provide the useful information for 
monitoring T-cell responses.

Since the emergence of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) in China at the end of 2019, when its characteristics were 
practically unknown, one aspect was evident: its high contagion rate. This high 
infection rate resulted in the spread of the virus in China, Europe, and, 
eventually, the rest of the world, including Mexico. At present, around 9 
million people are infected, and around 470,000 have died worldwide. In this 
context, the need to generate protective immunity, and especially the generation 
of a vaccine that can protect the world population against infection in the 
shortest possible time, is a challenge that is being addressed in different 
countries using different strategies in multiple clinical trials. This opinion 
article will present the evidence of the induction of immune response in some of 
the viruses of the coronavirus family before COVID-19, such as SARS-CoV and 
MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus). The information 
collected about the induction of an immune response by SARS-CoV-2 will be 
presented, as well as a description of the vaccine candidates reported to date 
in the various ongoing clinical trials. Finally, an opinion based on the 
evidence presented will be issued on the potential success of developing vaccine 
prototypes.

Publisher: Desde el surgimiento del nuevo coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus 
tipo 2 del síndrome respiratorio agudo severo) en China a finales del año 2019, 
cuando todavía era desconocido prácticamente en todos los aspectos, una 
característica era evidente: el alto índice de contagio entre la población. Esto 
resultó en la expansión del virus en China, Europa y, finalmente, en el resto 
del mundo, incluyendo México. Actualmente, alrededor de 9 millones de personas 
están infectadas, y han muerto cerca de 500,000 en todo el mundo. En este 
contexto, la necesidad de generar inmunidad protectora y, sobre todo, el 
desarrollo de una vacuna que pueda proteger a la población mundial contra la 
infección en el menor tiempo posible, es un reto que se está abordando en 
distintos países utilizando diversas estrategias en múltiples ensayos clínicos. 
En este artículo de opinión se presentan las evidencias de la inducción de 
respuesta inmunitaria con algunos de los virus de la familia de coronavirus 
previos al SARS-CoV-2, como el SARS-CoV (coronavirus del síndrome respiratorio 
agudo severo) y el MERS-CoV (síndrome respiratorio por coronavirus de Oriente 
Medio). Además, se presenta lo reportado hasta el momento acerca de la inducción 
de respuesta inmunitaria por el SARS-CoV-2, así como una descripción de los 
candidatos a vacunas informados hasta el momento en los distintos ensayos 
clínicos en curso. Finalmente se emite una opinión, basada en las evidencias 
presentadas, acerca del éxito potencial de los prototipos de vacunas en 
desarrollo.

The emergence of the global pandemic caused by novel severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has put a challenge to identify or derive 
the therapeutics for its prevention and treatment. Despite the unprecedented 
advances in the modern medicinal system, currently, there are no proven 
effective therapies. However, rapid research on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology help 
unveiling some new targets for potential drug therapies. Many drugs have been 
screened, and even their clinical trials are going on at an exceptional pace. 
Amongst these RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors (favipiravir and 
remdesivir) and steroids especially dexamethasone showed promising effects. The 
biological agents like tocilizumab, interferons, and convalescent plasma prove 
to be beneficial in viral clearance. Moreover, many immunomodulatory and viral S 
protein targeting vaccines have their ongoing clinical trials. The establishment 
of various in vitro and in vivo models for preclinical studies can additionally 
help the current research. The volume and the pace of the clinical trials 
launched to evaluate the safety and efficacy of various agents against 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reflect the need for high-quality evidence 
for various therapies to be practiced by clinicians. This study aims to sum up 
all the current advances in the global medicinal system against the COVID-19.

In this review, we address issues that relate to the rapid "Warp Speed" 
development of vaccines to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. We review the antibody 
response that is triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) infection of humans and how it may inform vaccine research. The 
isolation and properties of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 
patients provide additional information on what vaccines should try to elicit. 
The nature and longevity of the antibody response to coronaviruses are relevant 
to the potency and duration of vaccine-induced immunity. We summarize the 
immunogenicity of leading vaccine candidates tested to date in animals and 
humans and discuss the outcome and interpretation of virus challenge experiments 
in animals. By far the most immunogenic vaccine candidates for antibody 
responses are recombinant proteins, which were not included in the initial wave 
of Warp Speed immunogens. A substantial concern for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is 
adverse events, which we review by considering what was seen in studies of 
SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) vaccines. 
We conclude by outlining the possible outcomes of the Warp Speed vaccine 
program, which range from the hoped-for rapid success to a catastrophic adverse 
influence on vaccine uptake generally.

Amid the rapidly evolving global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic 
that has already had profound effects on public health and medical 
infrastructure globally, many questions remain about its impact on child health. 
The unique needs of neonates and children, and their role in the spread of the 
virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) should be 
included in preparedness and response plans. Fetuses and newborn infants may be 
uniquely vulnerable to the damaging consequences of congenitally- or 
perinatally-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, but data are limited about outcomes 
of COVID-19 disease during pregnancy. Therefore, information on illnesses 
associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (i.e., severe acute 
respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]), as 
well as comparisons to common congenital infections, such as cytomegalovirus 
(CMV), are warranted. Research regarding the potential routes of acquisition of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the prenatal and perinatal setting is of a high public 
health priority. Vaccines targeting women of reproductive age, and in particular 
pregnant patients, should be evaluated in clinical trials and should include the 
endpoints of neonatal infection and disease.

BACKGROUND: The recent outbreak by SARS-CoV-2 has generated a chaos in global 
health and economy and claimed/infected a large number of lives. Closely 
resembling with SARS CoV, the present strain has manifested exceptionally higher 
degree of spreadability, virulence and stability possibly due to some 
unidentified mutations. The viral spike glycoprotein is very likely to interact 
with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmits its genetic 
materials and hijacks host machinery with extreme fidelity for self propagation. 
Few attempts have been made to develop a suitable vaccine or ACE2 blocker or 
virus-receptor inhibitor within this short period of time.
METHODS: Here, attempt was taken to develop some therapeutic and vaccination 
strategies with a comparison of spike glycoproteins among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and 
the SARS-CoV-2. We verified their structure quality (SWISS-MODEL, Phyre2, and 
Pymol) topology (ProFunc), motifs (MEME Suite, GLAM2Scan), gene ontology based 
conserved domain (InterPro database) and screened several epitopes (SVMTrip) of 
SARS CoV-2 based on their energetics, IC50 and antigenicity with regard to their 
possible glycosylation and MHC/paratope binding (Vaxigen v2.0, HawkDock, ZDOCK 
Server) effects.
RESULTS: We screened here few pairs of spike protein epitopic regions and 
selected their energetic, Inhibitory Concentration50 (IC50), MHC II reactivity 
and found some of those to be very good target for vaccination. A possible role 
of glycosylation on epitopic region showed profound effects on epitopic 
recognition.
CONCLUSION: The present work might be helpful for the urgent development of a 
suitable vaccination regimen against SARS CoV-2.

The coronavirus family member, SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the causal 
agent for the pandemic viral pneumonia disease, COVID-19. At this time, no 
vaccine is available to control further dissemination of the disease. We have 
previously engineered a synthetic DNA vaccine targeting the MERS coronavirus 
Spike (S) protein, the major surface antigen of coronaviruses, which is 
currently in clinical study. Here we build on this prior experience to generate 
a synthetic DNA-based vaccine candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The 
engineered construct, INO-4800, results in robust expression of the S protein in 
vitro. Following immunization of mice and guinea pigs with INO-4800 we measure 
antigen-specific T cell responses, functional antibodies which neutralize the 
SARS-CoV-2 infection and block Spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor, and 
biodistribution of SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibodies to the lungs. This 
preliminary dataset identifies INO-4800 as a potential COVID-19 vaccine 
candidate, supporting further translational study.

This paper continues a recent study of the spike protein sequence of the 
COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2). It is also in part an introductory review to 
relevant computational techniques for tackling viral threats, using COVID-19 as 
an example. Q-UEL tools for facilitating access to knowledge and bioinformatics 
tools were again used for efficiency, but the focus in this paper is even more 
on the virus. Subsequence KRSFIEDLLFNKV of the S2' spike glycoprotein 
proteolytic cleavage site continues to appear important. Here it is shown to be 
recognizable in the common cold coronaviruses, avian coronaviruses and possibly 
as traces in the nidoviruses of reptiles and fish. Its function or functions 
thus seem important to the coronaviruses. It might represent SARS-CoV-2 
Achilles' heel, less likely to acquire resistance by mutation, as has happened 
in some early SARS vaccine studies discussed in the previous paper. Preliminary 
conformational analysis of the receptor (ACE2) binding site of the spike protein 
is carried out suggesting that while it is somewhat conserved, it appears to be 
more variable than KRSFIEDLLFNKV. However compounds like emodin that inhibit 
SARS entry, apparently by binding ACE2, might also have functions at several 
different human protein binding sites. The enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenase type 1 is again argued to be a convenient model pharmacophore 
perhaps representing an ensemble of targets, and it is noted that it occurs both 
in lung and alimentary tract. Perhaps it benefits the virus to block an 
inflammatory response by inhibiting the dehydrogenase, but a fairly complex web 
involves several possible targets.

PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is expected to continue to cause 
worldwide fatalities until the World population develops 'herd immunity', or 
until a vaccine is developed and used as a prevention. Meanwhile, there is an 
urgent need to identify alternative means of antiviral defense. Bacillus 
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine that has been recognized for its off-target 
beneficial effects on the immune system can be exploited to boast immunity and 
protect from emerging novel viruses.
METHODS: We developed and employed a systems biology workflow capable of 
identifying small-molecule antiviral drugs and vaccines that can boast immunity 
and affect a wide variety of viral disease pathways to protect from the fatal 
consequences of emerging viruses.
RESULTS: Our analysis demonstrates that BCG vaccine affects the production and 
maturation of naïve T cells resulting in enhanced, long-lasting trained innate 
immune responses that can provide protection against novel viruses. We have 
identified small-molecule BCG mimics, including antiviral drugs such as 
raltegravir and lopinavir as high confidence hits. Strikingly, our top hits 
emetine and lopinavir were independently validated by recent experimental 
findings that these compounds inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide systems biology support for using BCG and 
small-molecule BCG mimics as putative vaccine and drug candidates against 
emergent viruses including SARS-CoV-2.

Novel corona virus caused pneumonia first reported in December, 2019 in Wuhan, 
China was later named COVID-19. Due to its special pathogenicity, COVID-19 
transmitted with high speed beyond borders and has significantly affected normal 
life. Currently, no specific drugs, treatment or vaccines are available. Vaccine 
development for COVID-19 is a highly complex process involving viral genomic 
studies, identification of target for vaccine, vaccine design, manufacturing, 
storage and distribution, preclinical and clinical safety and efficacy studies. 
The high levels of efforts and global collaboration at this scale is 
unprecedented. The World Health Organization (WHO) has documented 160 different 
COVID-19 vaccine candidates as of July 13, 2020 with 26 currently on clinical 
evaluation while 137 vaccines on preclinical evaluation. COVID-19 vaccine 
efforts mark the first use of mRNA-type vaccines ever evaluated. Numerous 
research organizations have successfully initiated clinical evaluation of 
COVID-19 vaccines. This review aims to summarize the advances and challenges for 
COVID-19 vaccines development.

Since December 2019, more than 3 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) and about 200,000 deaths have been reported worldwide. The outbreak 
of this novel disease has become a global health emergency and continues to 
rapidly spread around the world. Based on the clinical data, approved cases are 
divided into four classes including mild, moderate, severe, and critical. About 
5% of cases were considered critically ill and 14% were considered to have the 
severe classification of the disease. In China, the fatality rate of this 
infection was about 4%. This review focuses on currently available information 
on the etiology, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and mechanism of action of 
COVID-19. Furthermore, we present an overview of diagnostic approaches and 
treatment of this disease according to available findings. This review paper 
will help the physician to diagnose and successfully treat COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: The newly emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, first reported in December 
2019, has infected about five and a half million people globally and resulted in 
nearly 9063264 deaths until the 24th of June 2020. Nevertheless, the highly 
contagious virus has instigated an unimaginably rapid response from scientific 
and medical communities.
OBJECTIVES: Pioneering research on molecular mechanisms underlying the viral 
transmission, molecular pathogenicity, and potential treatments will be 
highlighted in this review. The development of antiviral drugs specific to 
SARS-CoV-2 is a complicated and tedious process. To accelerate scientific 
discoveries and advancement, researchers are consolidating available data from 
associated coronaviruses into a single pipeline, which can be readily made 
available to vaccine developers.
METHODS: In order to find studies evaluating the COVID-19 virus epidemiology, 
repurposed drugs and potential vaccines, web searches and bibliographical bases 
have been used with keywords that matches the content of this review.
RESULTS: The published results of SARS-CoV-2 structures and interactomics have 
been used to identify potential therapeutic candidates. We illustrate recent 
publications on SARS-CoV-2, concerning its molecular, epidemiological, and 
clinical characteristics, and focus on innovative diagnostics technologies in 
the production pipeline. This objective of this review is to enhance the 
comprehension of the unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and strengthen future 
control measures.
LAY SUMMARY: An innovative analysis is evaluating the nature of the COVID-19 
pandemic. The aim is to increase knowledge of possible viral detection methods, 
which highlights several new technology limitations and advantages. We have 
assessed some drugs currently for patients (Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Anakinra and 
Interferon beta 1a), as the feasibility of COVID-19 specific antivirals is not 
presently known. The study explores the race toward vaccine development and 
highlights some significant trials and candidates in various clinical phases. 
This research addresses critical knowledge gaps by identifying repurposed drugs 
currently under clinical trials. Findings will be fed back rapidly to the 
researchers interested in COVID 19 and support the evidence and potential of 
possible therapeutics and small molecules with their mode of action.

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease is a general concern for the 
development of vaccines and antibody therapies because the mechanisms that 
underlie antibody protection against any virus have a theoretical potential to 
amplify the infection or trigger harmful immunopathology. This possibility 
requires careful consideration at this critical point in the pandemic of 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we review observations relevant to the 
risks of ADE of disease, and their potential implications for SARS-CoV-2 
infection. At present, there are no known clinical findings, immunological 
assays or biomarkers that can differentiate any severe viral infection from 
immune-enhanced disease, whether by measuring antibodies, T cells or intrinsic 
host responses. In vitro systems and animal models do not predict the risk of 
ADE of disease, in part because protective and potentially detrimental 
antibody-mediated mechanisms are the same and designing animal models depends on 
understanding how antiviral host responses may become harmful in humans. The 
implications of our lack of knowledge are twofold. First, comprehensive studies 
are urgently needed to define clinical correlates of protective immunity against 
SARS-CoV-2. Second, because ADE of disease cannot be reliably predicted after 
either vaccination or treatment with antibodies-regardless of what virus is the 
causative agent-it will be essential to depend on careful analysis of safety in 
humans as immune interventions for COVID-19 move forward.

Pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
infection emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. By Feb. 
11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease 
resulting from infection with SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
COVID-19 represents a spectrum of clinical manifestations that typically include 
fever, dry cough, and fatigue, often with pulmonary involvement. SARS-CoV-2 is 
highly contagious and most individuals within the population at large are 
susceptible to infection. Wild animal hosts and infected patients are currently 
the main sources of disease which is transmitted via respiratory droplets and 
direct contact. Since the outbreak, the Chinese government and scientific 
community have acted rapidly to identify the causative agent and promptly shared 
the viral gene sequence, and have carried out measures to contain the epidemic. 
Meanwhile, recent research has revealed critical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology 
and disease pathogenesis; other studies have focused on epidemiology, clinical 
features, diagnosis, management, as well as drug and vaccine development. This 
review aims to summarize the latest research findings and to provide expert 
consensus. We will also share ongoing efforts and experience in China, which may 
provide insight on how to contain the epidemic and improve our understanding of 
this emerging infectious disease, together with updated guidance for prevention, 
control, and critical management of this pandemic.

As of April 15, 2020, the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic 
has swept through 213 countries and infected more than 1,870,000 individuals, 
posing an unprecedented threat to international health and the economy. There is 
currently no specific treatment available for patients with COVID-19 infection. 
The lessons learned from past management of respiratory viral infections have 
provided insights into treating COVID-19. Numerous potential therapies, 
including supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, 
and convalescent plasma transfusion, have been tentatively applied in clinical 
settings. A number of these therapies have provided substantially curative 
benefits in treating patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, intensive 
research and clinical trials are underway to assess the efficacy of existing 
drugs and identify potential therapeutic targets to develop new drugs for 
treating COVID-19. Herein, we summarize the current potential therapeutic 
approaches for diseases related to COVID-19 infection and introduce their 
mechanisms of action, safety, and effectiveness.

A cluster of pneumonia (COVID-19) cases have been found in Wuhan China in late 
December, 2019, and subsequently, a novel coronavirus with a positive stranded 
RNA was identified to be the aetiological virus (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2), which has a phylogenetic similarity to 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS-CoV-2 transmits 
mainly through droplets and close contact and the elder or people with chronic 
diseases are high-risk population. People affected by SARS-CoV-2 can be 
asymptomatic, which brings about more difficulties to control the transmission. 
COVID-19 has become pandemic rapidly after onset, and so far the infected people 
have been above 2 000 000 and more than 130 000 died worldwide according to 
COVID-19 situation dashboard of World Health Organization 
(https://covid19.who.int). Here, we summarized the current known knowledge 
regarding epidemiological, pathogenesis, pathology, clinical features, 
comorbidities and treatment of COVID-19/ SARS-CoV-2 as reference for the 
prevention and control COVID-19.

The sudden outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later named 
SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, which rapidly grew into a global pandemic, marked 
the third introduction of a virulent coronavirus into the human society, 
affecting not only the healthcare system, but also the global economy. Although 
our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two 
precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control 
are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the 
epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We 
summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan 
studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it 
from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such 
as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical 
trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. 
Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic 
antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they 
require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of 
the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections 
and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response 
measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been 
tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, 
those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on 
immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses 
or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial 
clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such 
drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes 
with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial 
drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that 
the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug 
repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis.

18 years ago, in 2002, the world was astonished by the appearance of Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), supported by a zoonotic coronavirus, called 
SARS-CoV, from the Guangdong Province of southern China. After about 10 years, 
in 2012, another similar coronavirus triggered the Middle East Respiratory 
Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia. Both caused severe pneumonia killing 774 
and 858 people with 8700 cases of confirmed infection for the former, and 2494 
for the latter, causing significant economic losses. 8 years later, despite the 
MERS outbreak remaining in certain parts of the world, at the end of 2019, a new 
zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and responsible of coronavirus Disease 
(COVID-19), arose from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It spread rapidly and to 
date has killed 3,242 persons with more than 81,000 cases of infection in China 
and causing over 126,000 global cases and 5,414 deaths in 166 other countries 
around the world, especially Italy. SARS-CoV-2 would seem to have come from a 
bat, but the intermediate reservoir continues to be unknown. Nonetheless, as for 
SARS-CoV and MERS CoV, the Spillover effect linked to animal-human promiscuity, 
human activities including deforestation, illegal bush-trafficking and bushmeat, 
cannot be excluded. Recently, however, evidence of inter-human only transmission 
of SARS-CoV-2 has been accumulated and thus, the outbreak seems to be spreading 
by human-to-human transmission throughout a large part of the world. Herein we 
will provide with an update on the main features of COVID-19 and suggest 
possible solutions how to halt the expansion of this novel pandemic.

The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that 
emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries 
worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus 
(CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no 
licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the 
efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S 
protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates 
have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized 
animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 
infection. This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and 
therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and 
advances as made with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable 
efforts to halt this emerging virus infection.

The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a 
novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop 
ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for 
vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity 
between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and 
leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the 
experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the 
immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T 
cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map 
identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these 
identified epitopes among the 120 available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 
February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer 
protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a 
population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of 
epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in 
China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide 
experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the newly emerged severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) puts the world in an unprecedented crisis, 
leaving behind huge human losses and deep socioeconomic damages. Due to the lack 
of specific treatment against SARS-CoV-2, effective vaccines and antiviral 
agents are urgently needed to properly restrain the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Repositioned drugs such as remdesivir have revealed a promising clinical 
efficacy against COVID-19. Interestingly, nanomedicine as a promising 
therapeutic approach could effectively help win the battle between coronaviruses 
(CoVs) and host cells. This review discusses the potential therapeutic 
approaches, in addition to the contribution of nanomedicine against CoVs in the 
fields of vaccination, diagnosis and therapy.

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the global ratio between the dead and the 
survivors is approximately 1 to 10, which has put humanity on high alert and 
provided strong motivation for the intensive search for vaccines and drugs. It 
is already clear that if we follow the most likely scenario, which is similar to 
that used to create seasonal influenza vaccines, then we will need to develop 
improved vaccine formulas every year to control the spread of the new, highly 
mutable coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In this article, using well-known RNA viruses 
(HIV, influenza viruses, HCV) as examples, we consider the main successes and 
failures in creating primarily highly effective vaccines. The experience 
accumulated dealing with the biology of zoonotic RNA viruses suggests that the 
fight against COVID-19 will be difficult and lengthy. The most effective 
vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will be those able to form highly effective memory 
cells for both humoral (memory B cells) and cellular (cross-reactive antiviral 
memory T cells) immunity. Unfortunately, RNA viruses constantly sweep their 
tracks and perhaps one of the most promising solutions in the fight against the 
COVID-19 pandemic is the creation of 'universal' vaccines based on conservative 
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (antigen-presenting) and unmethylated CpG 
dinucleotides (adjuvant) in the composition of the phosphorothioate backbone of 
single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ODN), which can be effective for long 
periods of use. Here, we propose a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based on a lasso-like 
phosphorothioate oligonucleotide construction containing CpG motifs and the 
antigen-presenting unique ACG-containing genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2. We found 
that CpG dinucleotides are the most rare dinucleotides in the genomes of 
SARS-CoV-2 and other known human coronaviruses, and hypothesized that their 
higher frequency could be responsible for the unwanted increased lethality to 
the host, causing a 'cytokine storm' in people who overexpress cytokines through 
the activation of specific Toll-like receptors in a manner similar to TLR9-CpG 
ODN interactions. Interestingly, the virus strains sequenced in China (Wuhan) in 
February 2020 contained on average one CpG dinucleotide more in their genome 
than the later strains from the USA (New York) sequenced in May 2020. Obviously, 
during the first steps of the microevolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the human 
population, natural selection tends to select viral genomes containing fewer CpG 
motifs that do not trigger a strong innate immune response, so the infected 
person has moderate symptoms and spreads SARS-CoV-2 more readily. However, in 
our opinion, unmethylated CpG dinucleotides are also capable of preparing the 
host immune system for the coronavirus infection and should be present in 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as strong adjuvants.

The current global health threat by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) requires an urgent deployment of advanced therapeutic options 
available. The role of nanotechnology is highly relevant to counter this "virus" 
nano enemy. Nano intervention is discussed in terms of designing effective 
nanocarriers to counter the conventional limitations of antiviral and biological 
therapeutics. This strategy directs the safe and effective delivery of available 
therapeutic options using engineered nanocarriers, blocking the initial 
interactions of viral spike glycoprotein with host cell surface receptors, and 
disruption of virion construction. Controlling and eliminating the spread and 
reoccurrence of this pandemic demands a safe and effective vaccine strategy. 
Nanocarriers have potential to design risk-free and effective immunization 
strategies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine 
candidates such as protein constructs and nucleic acids. We discuss recent as 
well as ongoing nanotechnology-based therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to 
fight against this pandemic, outlining the key areas for nanoscientists to step 
in.

Objective: To evaluate and share the novel method for recruiting participants in 
clinical trials of vaccines in emergency situations. Methods: To publish 
recruitment notice in local areas of Wuhan through websites and medium, and 
guide interested persons to log in to the"Clinical Trials of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine 
Reservation and Health Declaration System"to appoint and register their health 
information. The "Health Declaration System" provides each volunteer evaluation 
and risk levels to preliminarily exclude those who do not meet the inclusion 
criteria. Researchers review the qualified volunteers by telephone, organize 
them to go to the vaccination site, and finally conduct a strict medical 
screening to determine the final subjects. Results: A total of 4 819 people and 
5 132 people registered in the Phase Ⅰ and Phase Ⅱ recruitment system 
respectively, with men 2 912 (60.43%) and 2 887 (56.25%) more than women 1 907 
(39.57%) and 2 245 (43.75%), mostly in the 20-39 age group, with 3 211 (66.63%) 
and 3 966 (77.28%). All 13 districts in Wuhan have interested residents to 
participate clinical research.The initial qualified rate of the Phase Ⅱ 
recruitment system was higher than that of Phase Ⅰ, with men 2 047 (70.28%) and 
2 135(73.95%), higher than women 1 083 (56.80%) and 1 472 (65.57%); 440 and 689 
people were reviewed by telephone in Phase Ⅰ and Phase Ⅱ respectively, and the 
number of verified volunteers was about 440 (35.00%) and 689 (67.20%); Of the 
201 603 people who arrived at the vaccination site, 12 and 26 of them were 
positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody with an antibody positive rate of 6.00% and 
4.31% respectively. Conclusion: The novel method for recruiting subjects in this 
clinical study is efficient and reliable, and the recruitment situation of Phase 
Ⅰ had set a good example for Phase Ⅱ but the medium-and long-term compliance of 
subjects and the separation of willingness and behaviors still need to be 
further studied.

The evidence on the pathophysiology of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 
infection is rapidly growing. Understanding why some patients suffering from 
COVID-19 are getting so sick, while others are not, has become an informal 
imperative for researchers and clinicians around the globe. The answer to this 
question would allow rationalizing the fear surrounding this pandemic. 
Understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 relies on an understanding of 
interplaying mechanisms, including SARS-CoV-2 virulence, human immune response, 
and complex inflammatory reactions with coagulation playing a major role. An 
interplay with bacterial co-infections, as well as the vascular system and 
microcirculation affected throughout the body should also be examined. More 
importantly, a compre-hensive understanding of pathological mechanisms of 
COVID-19 will increase the efficacy of therapy and decrease mortality. Herewith, 
presented is the current state of knowledge on COVID-19: beginning from the 
virus, its transmission, and mechanisms of entry into the human body, through 
the pathological effects on the cellular level, up to immunological reaction, 
systemic and organ presentation. Last but not least, currently available and 
possible future therapeutic and diagnostic options are briefly commented on.

INTRODUCTION: The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 
pandemic has expanded globally. The aim of the current study is to investigate 
the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of health care professionals in 
Greece towards SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: From 10-25 February 2020, 500 health care workers were approached. 
Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards SARS-CoV-2 were assessed via a 
personal interview questionnaire. For knowledge, each correct answer was given 1 
point; attitudes, or concerns aimed at prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 
practices, or behaviors towards performing preventive practices, were assigned 1 
point each. Points were summed and a score for each category was calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 461 health care workers returned the questionnaire and were 
included in the analysis (mean age ± SD: 44.2 ± 10.78 years, 74% females). The 
majority were nurses (47.5%), followed by physicians (30.5%) and paramedics 
(19%). The majority of subjects (88.28%) had a good level of knowledge 
(knowledge score equal to 4, or more). The majority of participants (71%) agreed 
with the temporary traveling restrictions ban. The uptake of a future vaccine 
against SARS-CoV-2 was estimated at 43%. Knowledge score was significantly 
associated with both attitudes score (p = 0.011) and practices score (p < 
0.001), indicating that subjects with a high knowledge score demonstrated a more 
positive perception on preventive measures and would practice more preventive 
measures. Attitudes score was significantly associated with practices score (p = 
0.009) indicating that subjects with a higher attitudes score are more likely to 
perform practices towards the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
CONCLUSION: There is a high level of knowledge concerning SARS-CoV-2 pandemic 
among Greek health care workers and this is significantly associated with 
positive attitudes and practices towards preventive health measures. The high 
level of knowledge of health professionals about SARS-CoV-2 may have contributed 
considerably to the successful management of the pandemic in Greece. Tailored 
educational campaigns aiming to increase the proportion of health care workers 
willing to accept a potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could be of paramount 
importance in future proactive vaccine educational campaigns.

The recent outbreak of the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has become a significant 
concern to public health care worldwide. As of August 19, 2020, more than 
22,140,472 people are infected, and over 781,135 people have died due to this 
deadly virus. In the USA alone, over 5,482,602 people are currently infected, 
and more than 171,823 people have died. SARS-CoV-2 has shown a higher 
infectivity rate and a more extended incubation period as compared to previous 
coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 binds much more strongly than SARS-CoV to the same 
host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Previously, several 
methods to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV have been tried with 
limited success. Since SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike (S) protein for entry to the 
host cell, it is one of the most preferred targets for making vaccines or 
therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we have summarised the 
characteristics of the S protein, as well as the different approaches being used 
for the development of vaccines and/or therapeutics based on the S protein.

SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 that has been 
characterized as a pandemic by the WHO. Since the first report of COVID-19 on 
December 31, 2019, 179,111 cases were confirmed in 160 countries/regions with 
7426 deaths as of March 17, 2020. However, there have been no vaccines approved 
in the world to date. In this study, we analyzed the biological characteristics 
of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, Pro330-Leu650 (SARS-CoV-2-SPL), using 
biostatistical methods. SARS-CoV-2-SPL possesses a receptor-binding region (RBD) 
and important B (Ser438-Gln506, Thr553-Glu583, Gly404-Aps427, Thr345-Ala352, and 
Lys529-Lys535) and T (9 CD4 and 11 CD8 T cell antigenic determinants) cell 
epitopes. High homology in this region between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV amounted 
to 87.7%, after taking the biological similarity of the amino acids into account 
and eliminating the receptor-binding motif (RBM). The overall topology indicated 
that the complete structure of SARS-CoV-2-SPL was with RBM as the head, and RBD 
as the trunk and the tail region. SARS-CoV-2-SPL was found to have the potential 
to elicit effective B and T cell responses. Our findings may provide meaningful 
guidance for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design.

Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), named a pandemic by the WHO, is the 
current global health crisis. National and international collaboration are 
indispensable for combating COVID-19 and other similar potential outbreaks. 
International efforts to tackle this complex problem have led to remarkable 
scientific advances. Yet, as a global society, we can and must take additional 
measures to fight this pandemic. Undoubtedly, our approach toward COVID-19 was 
not perfect, and testing has not been deployed fast enough to arrest the 
epidemic early on. It is critical that we revise our approaches to be more 
prepared for pandemics as a united body by promoting global cooperation and 
commitment.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with comparison to severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 
and pandemic H1N1 virus. SARS-CoV-2 may be originated from bats, and the 
patients and asymptomatic carriers are the source of epidemic infection. The 
virus can be transmitted human-to-human through droplets and close contact, and 
people at all ages are susceptible to this virus. The main clinical symptoms of 
the patients are fever and cough, accompanied with leukocytopenia and 
lymphocytopenia. Effective drugs have been not yet available thus far. In terms 
of the prevention and control strategies, vaccine development as the primary 
prevention should be accelerated. Regarding the secondary prevention, ongoing 
efforts of the infected patients and close contacts quarantine, mask wearing 
promotion, regular disinfection in public places should be continued. Meanwhile, 
rapid detection kit for serological monitoring of the virus in general 
population is expected so as to achieve early detection, early diagnosis, early 
isolation and early treatment. In addition, public health education on this 
disease and prevention should be enhanced so as to mitigate panic and mobilize 
the public to jointly combat the epidemic.

Rapid development of an effective vaccine for SARSCoV2 is a global priority. A 
controlled human infection model (CHIM) would accelerate the efficacy assessment 
of candidate vaccines. This strategy would require deliberate exposure of 
volunteers to SARSCoV2 with no currently available treatment and a small but 
definite risk of serious illness or death. This raises complex questions about 
the social and ethical acceptability of risk to individuals, given the potential 
benefit to the wider population, and as such, a study cannot be done without 
public involvement. We conducted a structured public consultation with 57 
individuals aged 20-40 years to understand public attitudes to a CHIM, and 
pre-requisites for enrolment. The overall response to this strategy was 
positive, and many would volunteer altruistically. Carefully controlled 
infection is viewed as safer than natural exposure to wild virus. The prolonged 
social isolation required for the proposed CHIM is considered an obstacle but 
not insurmountable, with reasonable compensation and supportive care. Given the 
significant level of public interest, a CHIM should be done as open science with 
regular, controlled dissemination of information into the public domain. 
Importantly, there was a strong view that the final decision whether to conduct 
a CHIM should be in the hands of qualified and experienced clinician-scientists 
and the authorities.

Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA 
genome infecting animals and humans. Coronaviruses have been described more than 
70 years ago and contain many species. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 
and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are lethal species caused by human 
coronaviruses (HCoVs). Currently, a novel strain of HCoVs, named Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 
(Covid-19). SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the 
capital city of the Hubei province of China, and has since spread worldwide 
causing an outbreak in more than 200 countries. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was 
declared a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 and a public health emergency of 
international concern (PHEIC) in late January 2020 by the World Health 
Organization (WHO). SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory tract causing flu-like 
symptoms and, in some, may cause severe illness like pneumonia and multi-organ 
failure leading to death. Today, Covid-19 cases almost reaching 9 million, with 
more than 450 thousand deaths. There is an urgent demand for developing a 
vaccine since no effective therapies or vaccines have been approved to this day 
to prevent or minimize the spread of the infection. In this review, we 
summarized the furthest vaccines in the clinical pipeline.

    bioRxiv. 2020 Mar 31;:

As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is rapidly progressing, the need for the development 
of an effective vaccine is critical. A promising approach for vaccine 
development is to generate, through codon pair deoptimization, an attenuated 
virus. This approach carries the advantage that it only requires limited 
knowledge specific to the virus in question, other than its genome sequence. 
Therefore, it is well suited for emerging viruses, for which we may not have 
extensive data. We performed comprehensive in silico analyses of several 
features of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence (e.g., codon usage, codon pair usage, 
dinucleotide/junction dinucleotide usage, RNA structure around the frameshift 
region) in comparison with other members of the coronaviridae family of viruses, 
the overall human genome, and the transcriptome of specific human tissues such 
as lung, which are primarily targeted by the virus. Our analysis identified the 
spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins as promising targets for deoptimization 
and suggests a roadmap for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, which can be 
generalizable to other viruses.

The emergence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to an unprecedented pandemic, which demands urgent 
development of antiviral drugs and antibodies; as well as prophylactic 
approaches, namely vaccines. Algae biotechnology has much to offer in this 
scenario given the diversity of such organisms, which are a valuable source of 
antiviral and anti-inflammatory compounds that can also be used to produce 
vaccines and antibodies. Antivirals with possible activity against SARS-CoV-2 
are summarized, based on previously reported activity against Coronaviruses or 
other enveloped or respiratory viruses. Moreover, the potential of algae-derived 
anti-inflammatory compounds to treat severe cases of COVID-19 is contemplated. 
The scenario of producing biopharmaceuticals in recombinant algae is presented 
and the cases of algae-made vaccines targeting viral diseases is highlighted as 
valuable references for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Successful 
cases in the production of functional antibodies are described. Perspectives on 
how specific algae species and genetic engineering techniques can be applied for 
the production of anti-viral compounds antibodies and vaccines against 
SARS-CoV-2 are provided.

BACKGROUND: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgency to identify 
novel vaccine targets for protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Early reports 
identify protective roles for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity for 
SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: We leveraged our bioinformatics binding prediction tools for human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I and HLA-II alleles that were developed using mass 
spectrometry-based profiling of individual HLA-I and HLA-II alleles to predict 
peptide binding to diverse allele sets. We applied these binding predictors to 
viral genomes from the Coronaviridae family and specifically focused on T cell 
epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We assayed a subset of these epitopes in a T 
cell induction assay for their ability to elicit CD8+ T cell responses.
RESULTS: We first validated HLA-I and HLA-II predictions on Coronaviridae family 
epitopes deposited in the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) 
database. We then utilized our HLA-I and HLA-II predictors to identify 11,897 
HLA-I and 8046 HLA-II candidate peptides which were highly ranked for binding 
across 13 open reading frames (ORFs) of SARS-CoV-2. These peptides are predicted 
to provide over 99% allele coverage for the US, European, and Asian populations. 
From our SARS-CoV-2-predicted peptide-HLA-I allele pairs, 374 pairs identically 
matched what was previously reported in the ViPR database, originating from 
other coronaviruses with identical sequences. Of these pairs, 333 (89%) had a 
positive HLA binding assay result, reinforcing the validity of our predictions. 
We then demonstrated that a subset of these highly predicted epitopes were 
immunogenic based on their recognition by specific CD8+ T cells in healthy human 
donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Finally, we characterized the 
expression of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in virally infected cells to prioritize 
those which could be potential targets for T cell immunity.
CONCLUSIONS: Using our bioinformatics platform, we identify multiple putative 
epitopes that are potential targets for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, whose HLA binding 
properties cover nearly the entire population. We also confirm that our binding 
predictors can predict epitopes eliciting CD8+ T cell responses from multiple 
SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Protein expression and population HLA allele coverage, 
combined with the ability to identify T cell epitopes, should be considered in 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design strategies and immune monitoring.

The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is expected to linger. Decisions 
regarding initiation or continuation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple 
sclerosis have to consider the potential relevance to the pandemic. 
Understanding the mechanism of action and the possible idiosyncratic effects of 
each therapeutic agent on the immune system is imperative during this special 
time. The infectious side-effect profile as well as the route and frequency of 
administration of each therapeutic agent should be carefully considered when 
selecting a new treatment or deciding on risk mitigation strategies for existing 
therapy. More importantly, the impact of each agent on the future severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine should be carefully 
considered in treatment decisions. Moreover, some multiple sclerosis therapies 
may have beneficial antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 while others may have 
beneficial immune-modulating effects against the cytokine storm and 
hyperinflammatory phase of the disease. Conventional injectables have a 
favorable immune profile without an increased exposure risk and therefore may be 
suitable for mild multiple sclerosis during the pandemic. However, moderate and 
highly active multiple sclerosis will continue to require treatment with oral or 
intravenous high-potency agents but a number of risk mitigation strategies may 
have to be implemented. Immune-modulating therapies such as the fumerates, 
sphinogosine-1P modulators, and natalizumab may be anecdotally preferred over 
cell-depleting immunosuppressants during the pandemic from the immune profile 
standpoint. Within the cell-depleting agents, selective (ocrelizumab) or 
preferential (cladribine) depletion of B cells may be relatively safer than 
non-selective depletion of lymphocytes and innate immune cells (alemtuzumab). 
Patients who develop severe iatrogenic or idiosyncratic lymphopenia should be 
advised to maintain social distancing even in areas where lockdown has been 
removed or ameliorated. Patients with iatrogenic hypogammaglobulinemia may 
require prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in certain situations. 
When the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine becomes available, patients with multiple 
sclerosis should be advised that certain therapies may interfere with mounting a 
protective immune response to the vaccine and that serological confirmation of a 
response may be required after vaccination. They should also be aware that most 
multiple sclerosis therapies are incompatible with live vaccines if a live 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is developed. In this article, we review and compare 
disease-modifying therapies in terms of their effect on the immune system, 
published infection rates, potential impact on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and 
vaccine-related implications. We propose risk mitigation strategies and 
practical approaches to disease-modifying therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 has affected the United States leading to a national emergency with 
health care and economic impact, propelling the country into a recession with 
disrupted lifestyles not seen in recent history. COVID-19 is a serious illness 
leading to multiple deaths in various countries including the United States. 
Several million Americans satisfy the Center for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) criteria for being high risk. Unfortunately, the available supply of 
medical beds and equipment for mechanical ventilation are much less than is 
projected to be needed. The World Health Organization (WHO) and multiple 
agencies led by the CDC in the United States have attempted to organize 
intensive outbreak investigation programs utilizing appropriate preventive 
measures, evaluation, and treatment. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies 
from asymptomatic forms to conditions encompassing multiorgan and systemic 
manifestations in terms of septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) 
syndromes. The presently approved treatments are supportive but not curative for 
the disease. There are multiple treatments being studied. These include 
vaccines, medications Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and potentially 
combination therapy. Finally, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or 
(UC-MSCs) may have a role and are being studied. The cure of COVID-19 is 
essentially dependent on the patients' own immune system. When the immune system 
is over activated in an attempt to kill the virus, this can lead to the 
production of a large number of inflammatory factors, resulting in severe 
cytokine storm. The cytokine storm may induce organ damage followed by the 
edema, dysfunction of air exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 
acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection, which may lead to death. Thus, at 
this point, the avoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment 
of HCOV-19 infected patients.In China, where there was limited availability of 
effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients were treated with 
expanded UC-MSCs. Additionally, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, 
Resuscitation and Intensive Care have reported guidelines to treat coronavirus 
patients with stem cells in the hope of decreasing the number of patients going 
to the ICU, and, also relatively quickly getting them out of ICU. In this 
manuscript, we describe the urgent need for various solutions, pathogenesis of 
coronavirus and the clinical evidence for treatment of COVID-19 with stem cells. 
The limited but emerging evidence regarding UC MSC in managing COVID-19 suggests 
that it might be considered for compassionate use in critically ill patients to 
reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States. The administration and 
Coronavirus Task Force might wish to approach the potential of expanded UC-MSCs 
as an evolutionary therapeutic strategy in managing COVID-19 illness with a 
3-pronged approach: If proven safe and effective on a specific and limited 
basis…1. Minimize regulatory burden by all agencies so that critically ill 
COVID-19 patients will have access regardless of their financial circumstance.2. 
Institute appropriate safeguards to avoid negative consequences from 
unscrupulous actors.3. With proper informed consent from patients or proxy when 
necessary, and subject to accumulation of data in that cohort, allow the 
procedure to be initiated in critically ill patients who are not responding to 
conventional therapies.KEY WORDS: Coronavirus, COVID-19, cytokine storm,

INTRODUCTION: Given the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and much of the U.S. 
implementing social distancing owing to the lack of alternatives, there has been 
a push to develop a vaccine to eliminate the need for social distancing.
METHODS: In 2020, the team developed a computational model of the U.S. 
simulating the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus and vaccination.
RESULTS: Simulation experiments revealed that to prevent an epidemic (reduce the 
peak by >99%), the vaccine efficacy has to be at least 60% when vaccination 
coverage is 100% (reproduction number=2.5-3.5). This vaccine efficacy threshold 
rises to 70% when coverage drops to 75% and up to 80% when coverage drops to 60% 
when reproduction number is 2.5, rising to 80% when coverage drops to 75% when 
the reproduction number is 3.5. To extinguish an ongoing epidemic, the vaccine 
efficacy has to be at least 60% when coverage is 100% and at least 80% when 
coverage drops to 75% to reduce the peak by 85%-86%, 61%-62%, and 32% when 
vaccination occurs after 5%, 15%, and 30% of the population, respectively, have 
already been exposed to COVID-19 coronavirus. A vaccine with an efficacy between 
60% and 80% could still obviate the need for other measures under certain 
circumstances such as much higher, and in some cases, potentially unachievable, 
vaccination coverages.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the vaccine has to have an efficacy of at 
least 70% to prevent an epidemic and of at least 80% to largely extinguish an 
epidemic without any other measures (e.g., social distancing).

As studies continue into the development of a vaccine for COVID-19, research to 
understand and address the concerns raised by anti-vaxxers about vaccinations 
should also be undertaken in tandem. Using the experience of Samoa, which was 
recently impacted by a measles epidemic, the authors discuss the importance of 
vaccination to developing countries and the devastation that can be wrought by 
vaccine-preventable diseases. There are fewer laws on vaccination of adults when 
compared to those applicable for children, and not all countries have mandatory 
vaccination laws in place. With increasing anti-vaxxer rhetoric towards the 
COVID-19 vaccine that is currently in development, the focus has been on 
reducing the spread of the misinformation through penalties or company 
interventions, but less so on addressing the underlying concerns of the 
anti-vaxxer community. The authors suggest that involving anti-vaxxers in the 
discussion is critical to the acceptance and uptake of the vaccine to COVID-19 
when it becomes available.

BACKGROUND: More than 100 COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in development since 
the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence was published in January 2020. The uptake of a 
COVID-19 vaccine among children will be instrumental in limiting the spread of 
the disease as herd immunity may require vaccine coverage of up to 80% of the 
population. Prior history of pandemic vaccine coverage was as low as 40% among 
children in the United States during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.
PURPOSE: To investigate predictors associated with global caregivers' intent to 
vaccinate their children against COVID-19, when the vaccine becomes available.
METHOD: An international cross sectional survey of 1541 caregivers arriving with 
their children to 16 pediatric Emergency Departments (ED) across six countries 
from March 26 to May 31, 2020.
RESULTS: 65% (n = 1005) of caregivers reported that they intend to vaccinate 
their child against COVID-19, once a vaccine is available. A univariate and 
subsequent multivariate analysis found that increased intended uptake was 
associated with children that were older, children with no chronic illness, when 
fathers completed the survey, children up-to-date on their vaccination schedule, 
recent history of vaccination against influenza, and caregivers concerned their 
child had COVID-19 at the time of survey completion in the ED. The most common 
reason reported by caregivers intending to vaccinate was to protect their child 
(62%), and the most common reason reported by caregivers refusing vaccination 
was the vaccine's novelty (52%).
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of caregivers intend to vaccinate their children 
against COVID-19, though uptake will likely be associated with specific factors 
such as child and caregiver demographics and vaccination history. Public health 
strategies need to address barriers to uptake by providing evidence about an 
upcoming COVID-19 vaccine's safety and efficacy, highlighting the risks and 
consequences of infection in children, and educating caregivers on the role of 
vaccination.

AIMS: With a large number of fatalities, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has 
greatly affected human health worldwide. Severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes COVID-19. The World Health 
Organization has declared a global pandemic of this contagious disease. 
Researchers across the world are collaborating in a quest for remedies to combat 
this deadly virus. It has recently been demonstrated that the spike glycoprotein 
(SGP) of SARS-CoV-2 is the mediator by which the virus enters host cells.
MAIN METHODS: Our group comprehensibly analyzed the SGP of SARS-CoV-2 through 
multiple sequence analysis and a phylogenetic analysis. We predicted the 
strongest immunogenic epitopes of the SGP for both B cells and T cells.
KEY FINDINGS: We focused on predicting peptides that would bind major 
histocompatibility complex class I. Two optimal epitopes were identified, 
WTAGAAAYY and GAAAYYVGY. They interact with the HLA-B*15:01 allele, which was 
further validated by molecular docking simulation. This study also found that 
the selected epitopes are able to be recognized in a large percentage of the 
world's population. Furthermore, we predicted CD4+ T-cell epitopes and B-cell 
epitopes.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides a strong basis for designing vaccine candidates 
against SARS-CoV-2. However, laboratory work is required to validate our 
theoretical results, which would lay the foundation for the appropriate vaccine 
manufacturing and testing processes.

IMPORTANCE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to the novel 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a 
worldwide sudden and substantial increase in hospitalizations for pneumonia with 
multiorgan disease. This review discusses current evidence regarding the 
pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19.
OBSERVATIONS: SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily via respiratory droplets during 
close face-to-face contact. Infection can be spread by asymptomatic, 
presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. The average time from exposure to 
symptom onset is 5 days, and 97.5% of people who develop symptoms do so within 
11.5 days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of 
breath. Radiographic and laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and 
elevated lactate dehydrogenase, are common, but nonspecific. Diagnosis is made 
by detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
testing, although false-negative test results may occur in up to 20% to 67% of 
patients; however, this is dependent on the quality and timing of testing. 
Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers and fulminant disease 
characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5% of 
patients with COVID-19, and 20% of those hospitalized, experience severe 
symptoms necessitating intensive care. More than 75% of patients hospitalized 
with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment for individuals with 
COVID-19 includes best practices for supportive management of acute hypoxic 
respiratory failure. Emerging data indicate that dexamethasone therapy reduces 
28-day mortality in patients requiring supplemental oxygen compared with usual 
care (21.6% vs 24.6%; age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.92]) and 
that remdesivir improves time to recovery (hospital discharge or no supplemental 
oxygen requirement) from 15 to 11 days. In a randomized trial of 103 patients 
with COVID-19, convalescent plasma did not shorten time to recovery. Ongoing 
trials are testing antiviral therapies, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. 
The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 varies markedly by age, ranging from 0.3 
deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 5 to 17 years to 304.9 deaths per 1000 
cases among patients aged 85 years or older in the US. Among patients 
hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the case fatality is up to 40%. At 
least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development. Until an effective vaccine 
is available, the primary methods to reduce spread are face masks, social 
distancing, and contact tracing. Monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune globulin 
may provide additional preventive strategies.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people 
worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many aspects of transmission, 
infection, and treatment remain unclear. Advances in prevention and effective 
management of COVID-19 will require basic and clinical investigation and public 
health and clinical interventions.

The COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging threat to global public health. While our 
current understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis is limited, a better 
understanding will help us develop efficacious treatment and prevention 
strategies for COVID-19. One potential therapeutic target is angiotensin 
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 primarily catalyzes the conversion of 
angiotensin I (Ang I) to a nonapeptide angiotensin or the conversion of 
angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) and has direct effects on 
cardiac function and multiple organs via counter-regulation of the 
renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Significant to COVID-19, ACE2 is postulated to 
serve as a major entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human cells, as it does for 
SARS-CoV. Many infected individuals develop COVID-19 with fever, cough, and 
shortness of breath that can progress to pneumonia. Disease progression promotes 
the activation of immune cells, platelets, and coagulation pathways that can 
lead to multiple organ failure and death. ACE2 is expressed by epithelial cells 
of the lungs at high level, a major target of the disease, as seen in 
post-mortem lung tissue of patients who died with COVID-19, which reveals 
diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates bilaterally. 
Comparatively, ACE2 is expressed at low level by vascular endothelial cells of 
the heart and kidney but may also be targeted by the virus in severe COVID-19 
cases. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection downregulates ACE2 expression, which 
may also play a critical pathogenic role in COVID-19. Importantly, targeting 
ACE2/Ang 1-7 axis and blocking ACE2 interaction with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 
to curtail SARS-CoV-2 infection are becoming very attractive therapeutics 
potential for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Here, we will discuss the 
following subtopics: 1) ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2; 2) clinical and 
pathological features of COVID-19; 3) role of ACE2 in the infection and 
pathogenesis of SARS; 4) potential pathogenic role of ACE2 in COVID-19; 5) 
animal models for pathological studies and therapeutics; and 6) therapeutics 
development for COVID-19.

By 27 February 2020, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused 
82 623 confirmed cases and 2858 deaths globally, more than severe acute 
respiratory syndrome (SARS) (8273 cases, 775 deaths) and Middle East respiratory 
syndrome (MERS) (1139 cases, 431 deaths) caused in 2003 and 2013, respectively. 
COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries internationally. Total fatality rate of 
COVID-19 is estimated at 3.46% by far based on published data from the Chinese 
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). Average incubation period 
of COVID-19 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0 to 24 days. The basic reproductive 
number (R0 ) of COVID-19 ranges from 2 to 3.5 at the early phase regardless of 
different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS. A study from 
China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or 
mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of 
infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing the spread of 
COVID-19. Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem. A total of 3019 
health workers were infected by 12 February 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of 
total number of infections, and extremely burdened the health system, especially 
in Wuhan. Limited epidemiological and clinical data suggest that the disease 
spectrum of COVID-19 may differ from SARS or MERS. We summarize latest 
literatures on genetic, epidemiological, and clinical features of COVID-19 in 
comparison to SARS and MERS and emphasize special measures on diagnosis and 
potential interventions. This review will improve our understanding of the 
unique features of COVID-19 and enhance our control measures in the future.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by a 
novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 
(SARS-CoV-2), which was identified at the end of 2019 in a cluster of pneumonia 
cases in Wuhan, China. It has likely affected everyone in the world either 
directly or indirectly, financially or through social isolation measures. There 
are now many publications about its etiology, epidemiology, investigations, and 
clinical presentation. Therefore, the medical community has a much better 
understanding of the disease as compared to a few months ago. There is no 
effective, safe treatment for COVID-19. There are many guidelines, clinical 
trials, and information on various media platforms that hinder the tracking of 
developments in this rapidly evolving situation. In this review, we provide a 
detailed update on various emerging treatment options and analyze the results of 
recent trials. This review also discusses current progress on finding a COVID-19 
vaccine.

Coronaviruses cause disease in animals and people around the world. Human 
coronaviruses (HCoV) are mainly known to cause infections of the upper and lower 
respiratory tract but the symptoms may also involve the nervous and digestive 
systems. Since the beginning of December 2019, there has been an epidemic of 
SARS-CoV-2, which was originally referred to as 2019-nCoV. The most common 
symptoms are fever and cough, fatigue, sputum production, dyspnea, myalgia, 
arthralgia or sore throat, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea (30%). The 
best prevention is to avoid exposure. In addition, contact per-sons should be 
subjected to mandatory quarantine. COVID-19 patients should be treated in 
specialist centers. A significant number of patients with pneumonia require 
passive oxygen therapy. Non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal oxygen 
therapy can be applied in mild and moderate non-hypercapnia cases. A lung-saving 
ventilation strategy must be implemented in acute respiratory distress syndrome 
and mechanically ventilated patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a 
highly specialized method, available only in selected centers and not applicable 
to a significant number of cases. Specific pharmacological treatment for 
COVID-19 is not currently available. Modern medicine is gearing up to fight the 
new coronavirus pandemic. The key is a holistic approach to the patient 
including, primar-ily, the use of personal protective equipment to reduce the 
risk of further virus transmission, as well as patient management, which 
consists in both quarantine and, in the absence of specific pharmacological 
therapy, symptomatic treatment.

BACKGROUND: Maintaining health of healthcare workers with vaccination is a major 
component of pandemic preparedness and acceptance of vaccinations is essential 
to its success. This study aimed to examine impact of the coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on change of influenza vaccination acceptance and 
identify factors associated with acceptance of potential COVID-19 vaccination.
METHOD: A cross-sectional self-administered anonymous questionnaire survey was 
conducted among nurses in Hong Kong, China during 26 February and 31 March 2020. 
Their previous acceptance of influenza vaccination and intentions to accept 
influenza and COVID-19 vaccination were collected. Their relationship with 
work-related and other factors were examined using multiple multinomial logistic 
regressions.
RESULTS: Responses from 806 participants were retrieved. More nurses changed 
from vaccination refusal to hesitancy or acceptance than those changed from 
acceptance to vaccination hesitancy or refusal (15.5% vs 6.8% among all 
participants, P < 0.001). 40.0% participants intended to accept COVID-19 
vaccination, and those in private sector (OR: 1.67, 95%CI: 1.11-2.51), with 
chronic conditions (OR: 1.83, 95%CI: 1.22-2.77), encountering with suspected or 
confirmed COVID-19 patients (OR: 1.63, 95%CI: 1.14-2.33), accepted influenza 
vaccination in 2019 (OR: 2.03, 95%CI: 1.47-2.81) had higher intentions to accept 
it. Reasons for refusal and hesitation for COVID-19 vaccination included 
"suspicion on efficacy, effectiveness and safety", "believing it unnecessary", 
and "no time to take it".
CONCLUSION: With a low level of COVID-19 acceptance intentions and high 
proportion of hesitation in both influenza and COVID-19 vaccination, 
evidence-based planning are needed to improve the uptake of both vaccinations in 
advance of their implementation. Future studies are needed to explore reasons of 
change of influenza vaccination acceptance, look for actual behaviour patterns 
of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and examine effectiveness of promotion 
strategies.

MERS-CoV seronegative and seropositive camels received a single intramuscular 
dose of ChAdOx1 MERS, a replication-deficient adenoviral vectored vaccine 
expressing MERS-CoV spike protein, with further groups receiving control 
vaccinations. Infectious camels with active naturally acquired MERS-CoV 
infection, were co-housed with the vaccinated camels at a ratio of 1:2 
(infected:vaccinated); nasal discharge and virus titres were monitored for 14 
days. Overall, the vaccination reduced virus shedding and nasal discharge 
(p = 0.0059 and p = 0.0274, respectively). Antibody responses in seropositive 
camels were enhancedby the vaccine; these camels had a higher average age than 
seronegative. Older seronegative camels responded more strongly to vaccination 
than younger animals; and neutralising antibodies were detected in nasal swabs. 
Further work is required to optimise vaccine regimens for younger seronegative 
camels.

BACKGROUND: The pandemic associated with the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus 
continues to spread worldwide. The most favorable epidemic control scenario, 
which provides long-term protection against COVID-19 outbreak, is the 
development and distribution of an effective and safe vaccine. The need to 
develop a new COVID-19 vaccine is pressing; however, it is likely to take a long 
time, possibly several years. This is due to the time required to demonstrate 
the safety and efficacy of the proposed vaccine. and the time required to 
manufacture and distribute millions of doses.
OBJECTIVES: To accelerate this development and associated safety testing, the 
deliberate infection of healthy volunteers has been suggested. The purpose of 
this short communication is to describe the ethical aspects of this type of 
testing, RESULTS: Deliberate infection of volunteers with a dangerous virus such 
as SARS-CoV-2 was initially considered unethical by researchers; but the current 
pandemic is so different from previous ones that these studies are considered 
ethical if certain criteria are met. Participants in human challenge studies 
must be relatively young, in good health and must receive the highest quality 
medical care, with frequent monitoring. Tests should also be performed with 
great caution and specialized medical supervision. Besides, the fact that 
obtaining vaccines faster through deliberate infection studies of healthy people 
has greater benefits than risks, has been demonstrated by obtaining other 
vaccines in other historical pandemics such as: smallpox, influenza, malaria, 
typhoid fever, Dengue fever and Zika.
CONCLUSIONS: One possibility to shorten the time required for the development of 
COVID-19 vaccines is to reduce clinical phases II and III by using human 
challenge studies through eliberate infection of healthy volunteers with 
SARS-CoV-2 after administration of the candidate vaccine. Accelerating the 
development of a COVID-19 vaccine even for a few weeks or months would have a 
great beneficial impact on public health by saving many lives.

BACKGROUND: As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is sweeping 
across the globe, there is an urgent need to develop effective vaccines as the 
most powerful strategy to end the pandemic. This study aimed to examine how 
factors related to vaccine characteristics, their social normative influence and 
convenience of vaccination can affect the public's preference for the uptake of 
the COVID-19 vaccine in China.
METHODS: An online discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey was administered to a 
sample of China's general population. Participants were asked to make a series 
of hypothetical choices and estimate their preference for different attributes 
of the vaccine. A mixed logit regression model was used to analyse the DCE data. 
Willingness to pay for each attribute was also calculated.
RESULTS: Data of 1236 participants who provided valid responses were included in 
the analysis. There was strong public preference for high effectiveness of the 
vaccine, followed by long protective duration, very few adverse events and being 
manufactured overseas. Price was the least important attribute affecting the 
public preference in selecting the COVID-19 vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS: The strong public preferences detected in this study should be 
considered when developing COVID-19 vaccination programme in China. The results 
provide useful information for policymakers to identify the individual and 
social values for a good vaccination strategy.
PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: The design of the experimental choices was fully 
based on interviews and focus group discussions participated by 26 Chinese 
people with diverse socio-economic backgrounds. Without their participation, the 
study would not be possible.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked with severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause severe illness and 
life-threatening pneumonia in humans. The current COVID-19 pandemic demands an 
effective vaccine to acquire protection against the infection. Therefore, the 
present study was aimed to design a multiepitope-based subunit vaccine (MESV) 
against COVID-19.
METHODS: Structural proteins (Surface glycoprotein, Envelope protein, and 
Membrane glycoprotein) of SARS-CoV-2 are responsible for its prime functions. 
Sequences of proteins were downloaded from GenBank and several immunoinformatics 
coupled with computational approaches were employed to forecast B- and T- cell 
epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 highly antigenic structural proteins to design an 
effective MESV.
RESULTS: Predicted epitopes suggested high antigenicity, conserveness, 
substantial interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) binding alleles, 
and collective global population coverage of 88.40%. Taken together, 276 amino 
acids long MESV was designed by connecting 3 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), 6 
helper T lymphocyte (HTL) and 4 B-cell epitopes with suitable adjuvant and 
linkers. The MESV construct was non-allergenic, stable, and highly antigenic. 
Molecular docking showed a stable and high binding affinity of MESV with human 
pathogenic toll-like receptors-3 (TLR3). Furthermore, in silico immune 
simulation revealed significant immunogenic response of MESV. Finally, MEV 
codons were optimized for its in silico cloning into the Escherichia coli K-12 
system, to ensure its increased expression.
CONCLUSION: The MESV developed in this study is capable of generating immune 
response against COVID-19. Therefore, if designed MESV further investigated 
experimentally, it would be an effective vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 to 
control and prevent COVID-19.

The pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 
at the end of 2019 marked the third outbreak of a highly pathogenic coronavirus 
affecting the human population in the past twenty years. Cross-species zoonotic 
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has caused severe pathogenicity and led to more than 
655,000 fatalities worldwide until July 28, 2020. Outbursts of this virus 
underlined the importance of controlling infectious pathogens across 
international frontiers. Unfortunately, there is currently no clinically 
approved antiviral drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, although several 
broad-spectrum antiviral drugs targeting multiple RNA viruses have shown a 
positive response and improved recovery in patients. In this review, we compile 
our current knowledge of the emergence, transmission, and pathogenesis of 
SARS-CoV-2 and explore several features of SARS-CoV-2. We emphasize the current 
therapeutic approaches used to treat infected patients. We also highlight the 
results of in vitro and in vivo data from several studies, which have broadened 
our knowledge of potential drug candidates for the successful treatment of 
patients infected with and discuss possible virus and host-based treatment 
options against SARS-CoV-2.

There is an urgent need for vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
because of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Among all approaches, a messenger 
RNA (mRNA)-based vaccine has emerged as a rapid and versatile platform to 
quickly respond to this challenge. Here, we developed a lipid 
nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA (mRNA-LNP) encoding the receptor binding domain 
(RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 as a vaccine candidate (called ARCoV). Intramuscular 
immunization of ARCoV mRNA-LNP elicited robust neutralizing antibodies against 
SARS-CoV-2 as well as a Th1-biased cellular response in mice and non-human 
primates. Two doses of ARCoV immunization in mice conferred complete protection 
against the challenge of a SARS-CoV-2 mouse-adapted strain. Additionally, ARCoV 
is manufactured as a liquid formulation and can be stored at room temperature 
for at least 1 week. ARCoV is currently being evaluated in phase 1 clinical 
trials.

The first case of COVID-19 was reported on 31 December 2019 in Wuhan, China. 
Ever since there has been unprecedented and growing interest in learning about 
all aspects of this new disease. Debate has been generated as to the association 
between antihypertensive therapy with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 
(RAAS) inhibitors and SARS-CoV-2 infection. While many questions as yet remain 
unanswered, the aim of this report is to inform health professionals about the 
current state of knowledge. Because this is an ever-evolving topic, the 
recommendation is that it be updated as new evidence becomes available. Below, 
we provide a review of pre-clinical and clinical studies that link coronavirus 
to the RAAS.

El 31 de diciembre de 2019 se reportó el primer caso de COVID-19 en Wuhan, 
China, y desde entonces ha habido un interés creciente y sin precedentes por 
conocer todos los aspectos vinculados con esta nueva enfermedad. Uno de los 
temas que ha generado debate se vincula con la asociación entre la terapia 
antihipertensiva con inhibidores del sistema renina-angiotensina-aldosterona y 
la infección por el virus SARS-CoV-2. Si bien muchas preguntas siguen hoy en día 
sin poder ser respondidas, la intención de este comunicado es informar a los 
profesionales de la salud acerca del estado actual de conocimiento. Dado que 
este es un tema en constante evolución, se recomienda su actualización a medida 
que se presenten nuevas evidencias. A continuación daremos revisión a los 
estudios preclínicos y clínicos que relacionan el coronavirus con el sistema 
renina-angiotensina-aldosterona.

The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat 
to global public health, calling for the development of safe and effective 
prophylactics and therapeutics against infection of its causative agent, severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as 2019 novel 
coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The CoV spike (S) protein plays the most important 
roles in viral attachment, fusion and entry, and serves as a target for 
development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines. Here, we identified 
the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein and found that the RBD 
protein bound strongly to human and bat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 
receptors. SARS-CoV-2 RBD exhibited significantly higher binding affinity to 
ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV RBD and could block the binding and, hence, 
attachment of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2-expressing cells, thus 
inhibiting their infection to host cells. SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies could 
cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein, and SARS-CoV RBD-induced antisera could 
cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the potential to develop SARS-CoV 
RBD-based vaccines for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection.

On 31 December 2019 the Wuhan Health Commission reported a cluster of atypical 
pneumonia cases that was linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, China. The 
first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019. 
Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to 
bat coronaviruses. As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500 
laboratory-confirmed cases, with > 100 known deaths. As with the SARS-CoV, 
infections in children appear to be rare. Travel-related cases have been 
confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including 
Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United 
States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Domestically in China, the virus has 
also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one 
provinence. While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of 
infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is 
now prevelant. Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been 
infected in the current epidemic. There are several critical clinical questions 
that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human 
transmission? What is the animal reservoir? Is there an intermediate animal 
reservoir? Do the vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their 
proteins offer protection against 2019-nCoV? We offer a research perspective on 
the next steps for the generation of vaccines. We also present data on the use 
of in silico docking in gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to 
aid in therapeutic development. Diagnostic PCR protocols can be found at

The recent emergence of the novel coronavirus (CoV) or severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a global threat to human health and 
economy. As of June 26, 2020, over 9.4 million cases of infection, including 
482,730 deaths, had been confirmed across 216 countries. To combat a devastating 
virus pandemic, numerous studies on vaccine development are urgently being 
accelerated. In this review article, we take a brief look at the characteristics 
of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome 
(MERS)-CoVs and discuss recent approaches to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) 
vaccine development.

The magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the urgency for a safe and 
effective vaccine. Many vaccine candidates focus on the Spike protein, as it is 
targeted by neutralizing antibodies and plays a key role in viral entry. Here we 
investigate the diversity seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences and compare it to the sequence on which most vaccine 
candidates are based. Using 18,514 sequences, we perform phylogenetic, 
population genetics, and structural bioinformatics analyses. We find limited 
diversity across SARS-CoV-2 genomes: Only 11 sites show polymorphisms in >5% of 
sequences; yet two mutations, including the D614G mutation in Spike, have 
already become consensus. Because SARS-CoV-2 is being transmitted more rapidly 
than it evolves, the viral population is becoming more homogeneous, with a 
median of seven nucleotide substitutions between genomes. There is evidence of 
purifying selection but little evidence of diversifying selection, with 
substitution rates comparable across structural versus nonstructural genes. 
Finally, the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence for the Spike protein, which is the 
basis for different vaccine candidates, matches optimized vaccine inserts, being 
identical to an ancestral sequence and one mutation away from the consensus. 
While the rapid spread of the D614G mutation warrants further study, our results 
indicate that drift and bottleneck events can explain the minimal diversity 
found among SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These findings suggest that a single vaccine 
candidate should be efficacious against currently circulating lineages.

Antibody-based drugs and vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are being expedited through preclinical and clinical 
development. Data from the study of SARS-CoV and other respiratory viruses 
suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could exacerbate COVID-19 through 
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Previous respiratory syncytial virus and 
dengue virus vaccine studies revealed human clinical safety risks related to 
ADE, resulting in failed vaccine trials. Here, we describe key ADE mechanisms 
and discuss mitigation strategies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapies in 
development. We also outline recently published data to evaluate the risks and 
opportunities for antibody-based protection against SARS-CoV-2.

Incidents of viral outbreaks have increased at an alarming rate over the past 
decades. The most recent human coronavirus known as COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has 
already spread around the world and shown R0 values from 2.2 to 2.68. However, 
the ratio between mortality and number of infections seems to be lower in this 
case in comparison to other human coronaviruses (such as severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus (MERS-CoV)). These outbreaks have tested the limits of healthcare 
systems and have posed serious questions about management using conventional 
therapies and diagnostic tools. In this regard, the use of nanotechnology offers 
new opportunities for the development of novel strategies in terms of 
prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and other viral infections. In 
this review, we discuss the use of nanotechnology for COVID-19 virus management 
by the development of nano-based materials, such as disinfectants, personal 
protective equipment, diagnostic systems and nanocarrier systems, for treatments 
and vaccine development, as well as the challenges and drawbacks that need 
addressing.

Major public and private laboratories have entered into a race to find an 
effective COVID-19 vaccine. When that vaccine arrives, the governments will have 
to implement vaccination programs to achieve the necessary immunization levels 
to prevent the disease transmission. In this context, the ethical dilemma of 
compulsory vaccination vs. voluntary vaccination will be raised. Underlying this 
dilemma, lies the problem of the ethical models on which the political decisions 
of governments in matters of health are based. The article proposes and argues 
the need to base health policy decisions on an ethical «first person» model, 
based on responsibility, that allows us to move from a normative ethic to an 
ethic of responsible behavior. This change in the ethical model, together with 
certain proposals for political action, will help us to restore institutional 
trust so that the necessary levels of collective immunity against COVID-19 can 
be achieved through the voluntary vaccination of the citizens.

When we have a vaccine against COVID-19, who should be vaccinated first? The 
question is relevant because, initially, vaccine availability will likely be 
limited. After healthcare and some other essential workers, it might seem the 
most obvious candidates are the elderly and other groups that are more 
vulnerable to the virus. However, we argue that this is not necessarily the 
case. Protecting the most vulnerable might require prioritizing vaccinating 
children in order to maximize the benefits of indirect immunity for the elderly 
and the other vulnerable groups. Whether this will be the best strategy from a 
public health perspective will depend on characteristics of the vaccine and of 
the virus, which are currently unknown. Here, we assess this possibility from an 
ethical point of view, by drawing comparisons and analogies with the case of the 
flu vaccination and with other examples of health policies and practices. We 
conclude that there are strong ethical reasons to vaccinate the young to protect 
the old, provided that the risks imposed on children are reasonable, even if 
that implies using children as a means to protect the elderly and the 
vulnerable.

A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has 
entered the human population and has spread rapidly around the world in the 
first half of 2020 causing a global pandemic. The virus uses its spike 
glycoprotein receptor-binding domain to interact with host cell 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) sites to initiate a cascade of events 
that culminate in severe acute respiratory syndrome in some individuals. In 
efforts to curtail viral spread, authorities initiated far-reaching lockdowns 
that have disrupted global economies. The scientific and medical communities are 
mounting serious efforts to limit this pandemic and subsequent waves of viral 
spread by developing preventative vaccines and repurposing existing drugs as 
potential therapies. In this review, we focus on the latest developments in 
COVID-19 vaccine development, including results of the first Phase I clinical 
trials and describe a number of the early candidates that are emerging in the 
field. We seek to provide a balanced coverage of the seven main platforms used 
in vaccine development that will lead to a desired target product profile for 
the "ideal" vaccine. Using tales of past vaccine discovery efforts that have 
taken many years or that have failed, we temper over exuberant enthusiasm with 
cautious optimism that the global medical community will reach the elusive 
target to treat COVID-19 and end the pandemic.

Virus neutralization remains the gold standard for determining antibody 
efficacy. Therefore, a high-throughput assay to measure SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing 
antibodies is urgently needed for COVID-19 serodiagnosis, convalescent plasma 
therapy, and vaccine development. Here, we report on a fluorescence-based 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay that detects SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies 
in COVID-19 patient specimens and yields comparable results to plaque reduction 
neutralizing assay, the gold standard of serological testing. The 
fluorescence-based neutralization assay is specific to measure COVID-19 
neutralizing antibodies without cross reacting with patient specimens with other 
viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections. Collectively, our approach offers a 
rapid platform that can be scaled to screen people for antibody protection from 
COVID-19, a key parameter necessary to safely reopen local communities.

IMPORTANCE: A vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is urgently 
needed.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an investigational 
inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine in China.
INTERVENTIONS: In the phase 1 trial, 96 participants were assigned to 1 of the 3 
dose groups (2.5, 5, and 10 μg/dose) and an aluminum hydroxide (alum) 
adjuvant-only group (n = 24 in each group), and received 3 intramuscular 
injections at days 0, 28, and 56. In the phase 2 trial, 224 adults were 
randomized to 5 μg/dose in 2 schedule groups (injections on days 0 and 14 
[n = 84] vs alum only [n = 28], and days 0 and 21 [n = 84] vs alum only 
[n = 28]).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Interim analysis of ongoing randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 clinical trials to assess an 
inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. The trials were conducted in Henan Province, 
China, among 96 (phase 1) and 224 (phase 2) healthy adults aged between 18 and 
59 years. Study enrollment began on April 12, 2020. The interim analysis was 
conducted on June 16, 2020, and updated on July 27, 2020.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary safety outcome was the combined adverse 
reactions 7 days after each injection, and the primary immunogenicity outcome 
was neutralizing antibody response 14 days after the whole-course vaccination, 
which was measured by a 50% plaque reduction neutralization test against live 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
RESULTS: Among 320 patients who were randomized (mean age, 42.8 years; 200 women 
[62.5%]), all completed the trial up to 28 days after the whole-course 
vaccination. The 7-day adverse reactions occurred in 3 (12.5%), 5 (20.8%), 4 
(16.7%), and 6 (25.0%) patients in the alum only, low-dose, medium-dose, and 
high-dose groups, respectively, in the phase 1 trial; and in 5 (6.0%) and 4 
(14.3%) patients who received injections on days 0 and 14 for vaccine and alum 
only, and 16 (19.0%) and 5 (17.9%) patients who received injections on days 0 
and 21 for vaccine and alum only, respectively, in the phase 2 trial. The most 
common adverse reaction was injection site pain, followed by fever, which were 
mild and self-limiting; no serious adverse reactions were noted. The geometric 
mean titers of neutralizing antibodies in the low-, medium-, and high-dose 
groups at day 14 after 3 injections were 316 (95% CI, 218-457), 206 (95% CI, 
123-343), and 297 (95% CI, 208-424), respectively, in the phase 1 trial, and 
were 121 (95% CI, 95-154) and 247 (95% CI, 176-345) at day 14 after 2 injections 
in participants receiving vaccine on days 0 and 14 and on days 0 and 21, 
respectively, in the phase 2 trial. There were no detectable antibody responses 
in all alum-only groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this interim report of the phase 1 and phase 2 
trials of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine, patients had a low rate of adverse 
reactions and demonstrated immunogenicity; the study is ongoing. Efficacy and 
longer-term adverse event assessment will require phase 3 trials.

Erratum in
    Cell Host Microbe. 2020 Sep 9;28(3):497.

There are as yet no licensed therapeutics for the COVID-19 pandemic. The causal 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) binds host cells via a trimeric spike whose receptor 
binding domain (RBD) recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, initiating 
conformational changes that drive membrane fusion. We find that the monoclonal 
antibody CR3022 binds the RBD tightly, neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, and report the 
crystal structure at 2.4 Å of the Fab/RBD complex. Some crystals are suitable 
for screening for entry-blocking inhibitors. The highly conserved, 
structure-stabilizing CR3022 epitope is inaccessible in the prefusion spike, 
suggesting that CR3022 binding facilitates conversion to the fusion-incompetent 
post-fusion state. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis confirms 
that incubation of spike with CR3022 Fab leads to destruction of the prefusion 
trimer. Presentation of this cryptic epitope in an RBD-based vaccine might 
advantageously focus immune responses. Binders at this epitope could be useful 
therapeutically, possibly in synergy with an antibody that blocks receptor 
attachment.

Recently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) emerged which is responsible for the 
recent outbreak in Wuhan, China. Genetically, it is closely related to SARS-CoV 
and MERS-CoV. The situation is getting worse and worse, therefore, there is an 
urgent need for designing a suitable peptide vaccine component against the 
SARS-COV-2. Here, we characterized spike glycoprotein to obtain immunogenic 
epitopes. Next, we chose 13 Major Histocompatibility Complex-(MHC) I and 3 
MHC-II epitopes, having antigenic properties. These epitopes are usually linked 
to specific linkers to build vaccine components and molecularly dock on 
toll-like receptor-5 to get binding affinity. Therefore, to provide a fast 
immunogenic profile of these epitopes, we performed immunoinformatics analysis 
so that the rapid development of the vaccine might bring this disastrous 
situation to the end earlier.

As the COVID-19 is still growing throughout the globe, a thorough investigation 
into the specific immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2, its interaction with the host 
immune system and pathogen evasion mechanism may provide a clear picture of how 
the pathogen can breach the host immune defenses in elderly patients and 
patients with comorbid conditions. Such studies will also reveal the underlying 
mechanism of how children and young patients can withstand the disease better. 
The study of the immune defense mechanisms and the prolonged immune memory from 
patients population with convalescent plasma may help in designing a suitable 
vaccine candidate not only for the current outbreak but also for similar 
outbreaks in the future. The vital drug candidates, which are being tested as 
potential vaccines or therapeutics against COVID-19, include live attenuated 
vaccine, inactivated or killed vaccine, subunit vaccine, antibodies, interferon 
treatment, repurposing existing drugs, and nucleic acid-based vaccines. Several 
organizations around the world have fast-tracked the development of a COVID-19 
vaccine, and some drugs already went to phase III of clinical trials. Hence, 
here, we have tried to take a quick glimpse of the development stages of 
vaccines or therapeutic approaches to treat this deadly disease.

This article discusses standard and new disruptive strategies in the race to 
develop an anti-COVID-19 vaccine. We also included new bioinformatic data from 
our group mapping immunodominant epitopes and structural analysis of the spike 
protein. Another innovative approach reviewed here is the use of BCG vaccine as 
priming strategy and/or delivery system expressing SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

Public health data suggested a rapid rise in COVID-19-confirmed cases in Nepal 
along with increased deaths. There has been a wide variation in clinical 
outcomes of this disease. Control of this pandemic depends on the availability 
of vaccines or drugs for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, viral and human genetics/genomics and 
immunology are necessary to understand whether these factors will affect 
clinical trials of vaccines in Nepal.

The reports suggesting a beneficial effect of nicotine on coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) severity may encourage smoking. We aimed to analyze tweets on 
COVID-19 and smoking coming from casual Twitter users and Twitter accounts 
representing the tobacco industry. We collected tweets on COVID-19 and smoking 
from January 1 to May 1, 2020, using Twitter application programming interface. 
We analyzed sentiment, likes, or retweet to followers ratios, and the posts 
coming from the casual users to find pieces of news that could affect the 
discourse. Tweets coming from industry were analyzed manually. We analyzed 
n = 33,890 tweets on COVID-19 and smoking. The sentiment of tweets was negative, 
hitting a nadir in mid-March, but became less negative in April when preprints 
suggesting benefits from smoking on COVID-19 were released. Similar trends were 
observed for the ratios of likes or retweets to followers. We found 58 messages 
from the tobacco industry concerning COVID-19. Twenty-two (37.9 percent) 
mentioned the efforts of tobacco companies to support the development of a 
COVID-19 vaccine. Two tweets included Food and Drug Administration statements 
that there is no evidence that vaping increases the risk of COVID-19. The 
occurrence of preprints suggesting benefits of smoking in COVID-19 might 
increase sentiment and reactions to tweets on tobacco products and the virus. 
The authors of potentially controversial articles should restrain from the 
promotion of their results before the completion of the peer-review process. 
Twitter presents a convenient tool to monitor e-discourse during a health 
crisis. The research community should monitor the tobacco industry's social 
media.

Due to the lack of protective immunity of humans towards the newly emerged 
SARS-CoV-2, this virus has caused a massive pandemic across the world resulting 
in hundreds of thousands of deaths. Thus, a vaccine is urgently needed to 
contain the spread of the virus. Here, we describe Newcastle disease virus (NDV) 
vector vaccines expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in its wild type or a 
pre-fusion membrane anchored format. All described NDV vector vaccines grow to 
high titers in embryonated chicken eggs. In a proof of principle mouse study, we 
report that the NDV vector vaccines elicit high levels of antibodies that are 
neutralizing when the vaccine is given intramuscularly. Importantly, these 
COVID-19 vaccine candidates protect mice from a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 
challenge with no detectable viral titer and viral antigen in the lungs.

New coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) treatments and vaccines are under development to 
combat COVID-19. Several approaches are being used by scientists for 
investigation, including (1) various small molecule approaches targeting RNA 
polymerase, 3C-like protease, and RNA endonuclease; and (2) exploration of 
antibodies obtained from convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered 
from COVID-19. The coronavirus genome is highly prone to mutations that lead to 
genetic drift and escape from immune recognition; thus, it is imperative that 
sub-strains with different mutations are also accounted for during vaccine 
development. As the disease has grown to become a pandemic, B-cell and T-cell 
epitopes predicted from SARS coronavirus have been reported. Using the epitope 
information along with variants of the virus, we have found several variants 
which might cause drifts. Among such variants, 23403A>G variant (p.D614G) in 
spike protein B-cell epitope is observed frequently in European countries, such 
as the Netherlands, Switzerland, and France, but seldom observed in China.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the urgent need 
for effective preventive vaccination to reduce burden and spread of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in humans. Intranasal 
vaccination is an attractive strategy to prevent COVID-19 as the nasal mucosa 
represents the first-line barrier to SARS-CoV-2 entry before viral spread to the 
lung. Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development is rapidly progressing, the 
current intramuscular vaccines are designed to elicit systemic immunity without 
conferring mucosal immunity. Here, we show that AdCOVID, an intranasal 
adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-vectored vaccine encoding the receptor binding domain 
(RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, elicits a strong and focused immune 
response against RBD through the induction of mucosal IgA, serum neutralizing 
antibodies and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a Th1-like cytokine expression 
profile. Therefore, AdCOVID, which promotes concomitant systemic and local 
mucosal immunity, represents a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by infection with the 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is having a 
deleterious impact on health services and the global economy, highlighting the 
urgent need for an effective vaccine. Such a vaccine would need to rapidly 
confer protection after one or two doses and would need to be manufactured using 
components suitable for scale up. Here, we developed an Alphavirus-derived 
replicon RNA vaccine candidate, repRNA-CoV2S, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) 
protein. The RNA replicons were formulated with lipid inorganic nanoparticles 
(LIONs) that were designed to enhance vaccine stability, delivery, and 
immunogenicity. We show that a single intramuscular injection of the 
LION/repRNA-CoV2S vaccine in mice elicited robust production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 
S protein IgG antibody isotypes indicative of a type 1 T helper cell response. A 
prime/boost regimen induced potent T cell responses in mice including 
antigen-specific responses in the lung and spleen. Prime-only immunization of 
aged (17 months old) mice induced smaller immune responses compared to young 
mice, but this difference was abrogated by booster immunization. In nonhuman 
primates, prime-only immunization in one intramuscular injection site or 
prime/boost immunizations in five intramuscular injection sites elicited modest 
T cell responses and robust antibody responses. The antibody responses persisted 
for at least 70 days and neutralized SARS-CoV-2 at titers comparable to those in 
human serum samples collected from individuals convalescing from COVID-19. These 
data support further development of LION/repRNA-CoV2S as a vaccine candidate for 
prophylactic protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The long incubation period of this new 
virus, which is mostly asymptomatic yet contagious, is a key reason for its 
rapid spread across the world. Currently, there is no worldwide-approved 
treatment for COVID-19. Therefore, the clinical and scientific communities have 
joint efforts to reduce the severe impact of the outbreak. Research on previous 
emerging infectious diseases have created valuable knowledge that is being 
exploited for drug repurposing and accelerated vaccine development. 
Nevertheless, it is important to generate knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms of 
infection and its impact on host immunity, to guide the design of COVID-19 
specific therapeutics and vaccines suitable for mass immunization. Nanoscale 
delivery systems are expected to play a paramount role in the success of these 
prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. This Review provides an overview of 
SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and examines immune-mediated approaches currently 
explored for COVID-19 treatments, with an emphasis on nanotechnological tools.

BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses pose a serious threat to global health as evidenced by 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 
(MERS), and COVID-19. SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 
and the novel coronavirus, previously dubbed 2019-nCoV, and now officially 
named SARS-CoV-2, are the causative agents of the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 
disease outbreaks, respectively. Safe vaccines that rapidly induce potent and 
long-lasting virus-specific immune responses against these infectious agents are 
urgently needed. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, a characteristic structural 
component of the viral envelope, is considered a key target for vaccines for the 
prevention of coronavirus infection.
METHODS: We first generated codon optimized MERS-S1 subunit vaccines fused with 
a foldon trimerization domain to mimic the native viral structure. In variant 
constructs, we engineered immune stimulants (RS09 or flagellin, as TLR4 or TLR5 
agonists, respectively) into this trimeric design. We comprehensively tested the 
pre-clinical immunogenicity of MERS-CoV vaccines in mice when delivered 
subcutaneously by traditional needle injection, or intracutaneously by 
dissolving microneedle arrays (MNAs) by evaluating virus specific IgG antibodies 
in the serum of vaccinated mice by ELISA and using virus neutralization assays. 
Driven by the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, we utilized this strategy to 
rapidly develop MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and tested their pre-clinical 
immunogenicity in vivo by exploiting our substantial experience with MNA 
MERS-CoV vaccines.
FINDINGS: Here we describe the development of MNA delivered MERS-CoV vaccines 
and their pre-clinical immunogenicity. Specifically, MNA delivered MERS-S1 
subunit vaccines elicited strong and long-lasting antigen-specific antibody 
responses. Building on our ongoing efforts to develop MERS-CoV vaccines, 
promising immunogenicity of MNA-delivered MERS-CoV vaccines, and our experience 
with MNA fabrication and delivery, including clinical trials, we rapidly 
designed and produced clinically-translatable MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines 
within 4 weeks of the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 sequence. Most 
importantly, these MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines elicited potent 
antigen-specific antibody responses that were evident beginning 2 weeks after 
immunization.
INTERPRETATION: MNA delivery of coronaviruses-S1 subunit vaccines is a promising 
immunization strategy against coronavirus infection. Progressive scientific and 
technological efforts enable quicker responses to emerging pandemics. Our 
ongoing efforts to develop MNA-MERS-S1 subunit vaccines enabled us to rapidly 
design and produce MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines capable of inducing potent 
virus-specific antibody responses. Collectively, our results support the 
clinical development of MNA delivered recombinant protein subunit vaccines 
against SARS, MERS, COVID-19, and other emerging infectious diseases.

Optimal Dynamic Prioritization of Scarce COVID-19 Vaccines.

Buckner JH, Chowell G, Springborn MR.

Multiple promising COVID-19 vaccines are under rapid development, with 
deployment of the initial supply expected by 2021. Careful design of a vaccine 
prioritization strategy across socio-demographic groups is an imminent and 
crucial public policy challenge given that (1) the eventual vaccine supply will 
be highly constrained for at least the first several months of the vaccination 
campaign, and (2) there are stark differences in transmission and severity of 
impacts from SARS-CoV-2 across groups. Previous experience with vaccine 
development mid-pandemic offers limited insights for SARS-CoV-2 prioritization: 
SARS and Zika vaccine development was incomplete when those outbreaks ended and 
the epidemiology of endemic human influenza viruses differ substantially from 
that of SARS-CoV-2. We assess the optimal allocation of a limited and dynamic 
COVID-19 vaccine supply in the U.S. across socio-demographic groups 
differentiated by age and essential worker status. The transmission dynamics are 
modeled using a compartmental (SEIR) model parameterized to capture our current 
understanding of the transmission and epidemiological characteristics of 
COVID-19, including key sources of group heterogeneity (susceptibility, 
severity, and contact rates). We investigate tradeoffs between three alternative 
policy objectives: minimizing infections, years of life lost, or deaths. 
Moreover, we model dynamic vaccine prioritization policies that respond to 
changes in the epidemiological status of the population as SARS-CoV-2 continues 
its march. Because contacts tend to be concentrated within age groups, there is 
diminishing marginal returns as vaccination coverage increases in a given group, 
increasing the group's protective immunity against infection and mortality. We 
find that optimal prioritization consistently targets older essential workers. 
However, depending on the policy objective, younger essential workers are 
prioritized to minimize infections or seniors in order to minimize mortality. 
Optimal prioritization outperforms non-targeted vaccination strategies by up to 
18% depending on the outcome optimized. For example, in our baseline model, 
cumulative mortality decreased on average by 17% (25,000 deaths in the U.S. 
population) over the course of the outbreak.

The COVID-19 outbreak has fueled a global demand for effective diagnosis and 
treatment as well as mitigation of the spread of infection, all through 
large-scale approaches such as specific alternative antiviral methods and 
classical disinfection protocols. Based on an abundance of engineered materials 
identifiable by their useful physicochemical properties through versatile 
chemical functionalization, nanotechnology offers a number of approaches to cope 
with this emergency. Here, through a multidisciplinary Perspective encompassing 
diverse fields such as virology, biology, medicine, engineering, chemistry, 
materials science, and computational science, we outline how 
nanotechnology-based strategies can support the fight against COVID-19, as well 
as infectious diseases in general, including future pandemics. Considering what 
we know so far about the life cycle of the virus, we envision key steps where 
nanotechnology could counter the disease. First, nanoparticles (NPs) can offer 
alternative methods to classical disinfection protocols used in healthcare 
settings, thanks to their intrinsic antipathogenic properties and/or their 
ability to inactivate viruses, bacteria, fungi, or yeasts either photothermally 
or via photocatalysis-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. 
Nanotechnology tools to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in patients could also be 
explored. In this case, nanomaterials could be used to deliver drugs to the 
pulmonary system to inhibit interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 
(ACE2) receptors and viral S protein. Moreover, the concept of "nanoimmunity by 
design" can help us to design materials for immune modulation, either 
stimulating or suppressing the immune response, which would find applications in 
the context of vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 or in counteracting the 
cytokine storm, respectively. In addition to disease prevention and therapeutic 
potential, nanotechnology has important roles in diagnostics, with potential to 
support the development of simple, fast, and cost-effective nanotechnology-based 
assays to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and related biomarkers. In summary, 
nanotechnology is critical in counteracting COVID-19 and will be vital when 
preparing for future pandemics.

As of April 9, 2020, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) had caused 89,931 deaths 
and 1,503,900 confirmed cases worldwide, which indicates an increasingly severe 
and uncontrollable situation. Initially, little was known about the virus. As 
research continues, we now know the genome structure, epidemiological and 
clinical characteristics, and pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. Based on this 
knowledge, potential targets involved in the processes of virus pathogenesis 
need to be identified, and the discovery or development of drugs based on these 
potential targets is the most pressing need. Here, we have summarized the 
potential therapeutic targets involved in virus pathogenesis and discuss the 
advances, possibilities, and significance of drugs based on these targets for 
treating SARS-CoV-2. This review will facilitate the identification of potential 
targets and provide clues for drug development that can be translated into 
clinical applications for combating SARS-CoV-2.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) threatens global public health. 
The development of a vaccine is urgently needed for the prevention and control 
of COVID-19. Here, we report the pilot-scale production of an inactivated 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (BBIBP-CorV) that induces high levels of 
neutralizing antibodies titers in mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and nonhuman 
primates (cynomolgus monkeys and rhesus macaques) to provide protection against 
SARS-CoV-2. Two-dose immunizations using 2 μg/dose of BBIBP-CorV provided highly 
efficient protection against SARS-CoV-2 intratracheal challenge in rhesus 
macaques, without detectable antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. In 
addition, BBIBP-CorV exhibits efficient productivity and good genetic stability 
for vaccine manufacture. These results support the further evaluation of 
BBIBP-CorV in a clinical trial.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world, with the United States 
being highly affected. A vaccine provides the best hope for a permanent solution 
to controlling the pandemic. However, to be effective, a vaccine must be 
accepted and used by a large majority of the population. The aim of this study 
was to understand the attitudes towards and obstacles facing vaccination with a 
potential COVID-19 vaccine. To measure these attitudes a survey was administered 
to 316 respondents across the United States by a survey corporation. Structural 
equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships of several factors with 
attitudes toward potential COVID-19 vaccination. Prior vaccine usage and 
attitudes predicted attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Assessment of the 
severity of COVID-19 for the United States was also predictive. Approximately 
68% of all respondents were supportive of being vaccinated for COVID-19, but 
side effects, efficacy and length of testing remained concerns. Longer testing, 
increased efficacy and development in the United States were significantly 
associated with increased vaccine acceptance. Messages promoting COVID-19 
vaccination should seek to alleviate the concerns of those who are already 
vaccine-hesitant. Messaging directed at the benefits of vaccination for the 
United States as a country would address the second predictive factor. Enough 
time should be taken to allay concerns about both short- and long-term side 
effects before a vaccine is released.

Vaccination is an effective measure to control the diffusion of infectious 
disease such as COVID-19. This paper analyzes the basic reproduction number in 
South Korea which enables us to identify a necessary level of vaccine stockpile 
to achieve herd immunity. An susceptible-infected-susceptible model is adopted 
that allows a stochastic diffusion. The result shows that the basic reproduction 
number of South Korea is approximately 2 which is substantially lower than those 
of the other regions. The herd immunity calculated from economic-epidemiological 
model suggests that at least 62% of the susceptible population be vaccinated 
when COVID-19 vaccine becomes available.

Molecular understanding of neutralizing antibody responses to severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could accelerate vaccine design 
and drug discovery. We analyzed 294 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and found that 
immunoglobulin G heavy-chain variable region 3-53 (IGHV3-53) is the most 
frequently used IGHV gene for targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the 
spike protein. Co-crystal structures of two IGHV3-53-neutralizing antibodies 
with RBD, with or without Fab CR3022, at 2.33- to 3.20-angstrom resolution 
revealed that the germline-encoded residues dominate recognition of the 
angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding site. This binding mode limits 
the IGHV3-53 antibodies to short complementarity-determining region H3 loops but 
accommodates light-chain diversity. These IGHV3-53 antibodies show minimal 
affinity maturation and high potency, which is promising for vaccine design. 
Knowledge of these structural motifs and binding mode should facilitate the 
design of antigens that elicit this type of neutralizing response.

Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination has been reported to decrease 
susceptibility to respiratory tract infections, an effect proposed to be 
mediated by the general long-term boosting of innate immune mechanisms, also 
termed trained immunity. Here, we discuss the non-specific beneficial effects of 
BCG against viral infections and whether this vaccine may afford protection to 
COVID-19.

Could the BCG vaccine be used to bridge the gap until a specific COVID-19 
vaccine is developed? Luke O’Neill and Mihai Netea discuss the science behind 
this approach.

The unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has created a 
worldwide public health emergency, and there is an urgent need to develop an 
effective vaccine to control this severe infectious disease. Here, we find that 
a single vaccination with a replication-defective human type 5 adenovirus 
encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Ad5-nCoV) protect mice completely against 
mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. 
Additionally, a single vaccination with Ad5-nCoV protects ferrets from wild-type 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper respiratory tract. This study suggests that 
the mucosal vaccination may provide a desirable protective efficacy and this 
delivery mode is worth further investigation in human clinical trials.

Vaccines are urgently needed to control the ongoing pandemic COVID-19 and 
previously emerging MERS/SARS caused by coronavirus (CoV) infections. The CoV 
spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) is an attractive vaccine target but is 
undermined by limited immunogenicity. We describe a dimeric form of MERS-CoV RBD 
that overcomes this limitation. The RBD-dimer significantly increased 
neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers compared to conventional monomeric form and 
protected mice against MERS-CoV infection. Crystal structure showed RBD-dimer 
fully exposed dual receptor-binding motifs, the major target for NAbs. 
Structure-guided design further yielded a stable version of RBD-dimer as a 
tandem repeat single-chain (RBD-sc-dimer) which retained the vaccine potency. We 
generalized this strategy to design vaccines against COVID-19 and SARS, 
achieving 10- to 100-fold enhancement of NAb titers. RBD-sc-dimers in pilot 
scale production yielded high yields, supporting their scalability for further 
clinical development. The framework of immunogen design can be universally 
applied to other beta-CoV vaccines to counter emerging threats.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused millions 
of human infections, and an effective vaccine is critical to mitigate 
coronavirus-induced disease 2019 (COVID-19). Previously, we developed a 
replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing a modified 
form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene in place of the native glycoprotein gene 
(VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2). Here, we show that vaccination with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 
generates neutralizing immune responses and protects mice from SARS-CoV-2. 
Immunization of mice with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 elicits high antibody titers that 
neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and target the receptor binding domain that engages human 
angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Upon challenge with a human isolate of 
SARS-CoV-2, mice that expressed human ACE2 and were immunized with 
VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 show profoundly reduced viral infection and inflammation in 
the lung, indicating protection against pneumonia. Passive transfer of sera from 
VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-immunized animals also protects naive mice from SARS-CoV-2 
challenge. These data support development of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 as an attenuated, 
replication-competent vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to accelerated efforts 
to develop therapeutics and vaccines. A key target of these efforts is the spike 
(S) protein, which is metastable and difficult to produce recombinantly. We 
characterized 100 structure-guided spike designs and identified 26 individual 
substitutions that increased protein yields and stability. Testing combinations 
of beneficial substitutions resulted in the identification of HexaPro, a variant 
with six beneficial proline substitutions exhibiting higher expression than its 
parental construct (by a factor of 10) as well as the ability to withstand heat 
stress, storage at room temperature, and three freeze-thaw cycles. A 
cryo-electron microscopy structure of HexaPro at a resolution of 3.2 angstroms 
confirmed that it retains the prefusion spike conformation. High-yield 
production of a stabilized prefusion spike protein will accelerate the 
development of vaccines and serological diagnostics for severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

During the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute 
respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to the infection 
of millions of people and has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The entry 
of the virus into cells depends on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the 
spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Although there is currently no vaccine, it is 
likely that antibodies will be essential for protection. However, little is 
known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-21-5. Here we report on 149 
COVID-19-convalescent individuals. Plasma samples collected an average of 
39 days after the onset of symptoms had variable half-maximal pseudovirus 
neutralizing titres; titres were less than 50 in 33% of samples, below 1,000 in 
79% of samples and only 1% of samples had titres above 5,000. Antibody 
sequencing revealed the expansion of clones of RBD-specific memory B cells that 
expressed closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low 
plasma titres, antibodies to three distinct epitopes on the RBD neutralized the 
virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) as low as 
2 ng ml-1. In conclusion, most convalescent plasma samples obtained from 
individuals who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing 
activity. Nevertheless, rare but recurring RBD-specific antibodies with potent 
antiviral activity were found in all individuals tested, suggesting that a 
vaccine designed to elicit such antibodies could be broadly effective.

Rapid development of an efficacious vaccine against the viral pathogen 
SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, is 
essential, but rigorous studies are required to determine the safety of 
candidate vaccines. Here, on behalf of the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic 
Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) Working Group, we evaluate research on the 
potential risk of immune enhancement of disease by vaccines and viral 
infections, including coronavirus infections, together with emerging data about 
COVID-19 disease. Vaccine-associated enhanced disease has been rarely 
encountered with existing vaccines or viral infections. Although animal models 
of SARS-CoV-2 infection may elucidate mechanisms of immune protection, we need 
observations of enhanced disease in people receiving candidate COVID-19 vaccines 
to understand the risk of immune enhancement of disease. Neither principles of 
immunity nor preclinical studies provide a basis for prioritizing among the 
COVID-19 vaccine candidates with respect to safety at this time. Rigorous 
clinical trial design and post-licensure surveillance should provide a reliable 
strategy to identify adverse events, including the potential for enhanced 
severity of COVID-19 disease, following vaccination.

While adult clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines have moved quickly into Phase 3 
clinical trials, clinical trials have not started in children in the US. The 
direct COVID-19 impact upon children is greater than that observed for a number 
of other pathogens for which we now have effective pediatric vaccines. 
Additionally, the role of children in SARS-CoV-2 transmission has clearly been 
underappreciated. Carefully conducted Phase II clinical trials can adequately 
address potential COVID-19 vaccine safety concerns. Delaying Phase II vaccine 
clinical trials in children will delay our recovery from COVID-19 and 
unnecessarily prolong its impact upon children's education, health and emotional 
well-being, and equitable access to opportunities for development and social 
success. Given the potential direct and indirect benefits of pediatric 
vaccination, implementation of Phase II clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines 
should begin now.

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has prioritized the 
development of small-animal models for severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We adapted a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 by 
serial passaging in the respiratory tract of aged BALB/c mice. The resulting 
mouse-adapted strain at passage 6 (called MASCp6) showed increased infectivity 
in mouse lung and led to interstitial pneumonia and inflammatory responses in 
both young and aged mice after intranasal inoculation. Deep sequencing revealed 
a panel of adaptive mutations potentially associated with the increased 
virulence. In particular, the N501Y mutation is located at the receptor binding 
domain (RBD) of the spike protein. The protective efficacy of a recombinant RBD 
vaccine candidate was validated by using this model. Thus, this mouse-adapted 
strain and associated challenge model should be of value in evaluating vaccines 
and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic has shaken the 
global health system and economy by their roots. This epidemic is still 
spreading and showing no signs of decreasing trend. Vaccination could be the 
only effective and economical means to control this pandemic. A number of 
research institutions and pharmaceutical companies have plunged into the race of 
vaccine development against COVID-19 which are in various stages of development. 
An intriguing fact of coronavirus infections is that in every decade of the 21st 
century there is a new major coronavirus epidemic, namely, severe acute 
respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 
2012, and now COVID-19; and such epidemics are expected in future too. Since 
most of the biological characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still obscure, the scientists are relying on the 
information available on SARS-CoV and to some extent on MERS-CoV for designing 
and developing COVID-19 vaccines. But there is a need of vigorous testing for 
immunogenicity, safety, efficacy, and level of protection conferred in the 
hosts. This review focuses on the challenges and prospects of vaccine 
development against COVID-19. It highlights seriousness, bottlenecks in vaccine 
development, possible vaccine candidates, different vaccine strategies, safety 
evaluation issues, and vaccine production processes pertaining to COVID-19 based 
on the knowledge acquired on SARS and MERS vaccine development in the past.

The world is witnessing a difficult time. The race of developing a new 
coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine is becoming more urgent. Many preliminary studies 
on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 patients have provided some clues to treat 
this pandemic. However, no suitable treatment has found yet. Various symptoms of 
patients infected with COVID-19 indicated the importance of immune regulation in 
the human body. Severe cases admitted to the intensive care unit showed high 
level of pro-inflammatory cytokines which enhanced the disease severity. Acute 
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients is another critical 
factor of disease severity and mortality. So, Immune modulation is the only way 
of regulating immune system. Nigella sativa has been used for medicinal purposes 
for centuries. The components of this plant are known for its intense 
immune-regulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant benefits in obstructive 
respiratory disorders. A molecular docking study also gave evidences that N. 
sativa decelerates COVID-19 and might give the same or better results than the 
FDA approved drugs. The aim of this review was to investigate the possible 
immune-regulatory effects of N. sativa on COVID-19 pandemic. Our review found N. 
sativa's Thymoquinone, Nigellidine, and α-hederin can be a potential influencer 
in reinforcing the immune response on molecular grounds.

In the late autumn of 2019, a new potentially lethal human coronavirus 
designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged 
in Wuhan, China. The pandemic spread of this zoonotic virus has created a global 
health emergency and an unprecedented socioeconomic crisis. The severity of 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by SARS-CoV‑2, is highly 
variable. Most patients (~85%) develop no or mild symptoms, while others become 
seriously ill, some succumbing to disease-related complications. In this review, 
the SARS-CoV‑2 life cycle, its transmission and the clinical and immunological 
features of COVID-19 are described. In addition, an overview is presented of the 
virological assays for detecting ongoing SARS-CoV‑2 infections and the 
serological tests for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody detection. Also discussed are 
the different approaches to developing a COVID-19 vaccine and the perspectives 
of treating COVID-19 with antiviral drugs, immunomodulatory agents and 
anticoagulants/antithrombotics. Finally, the cardiovascular manifestations of 
COVID-19 are briefly touched upon. While there is still much to learn about 
SARS-CoV‑2, the tremendous recent advances in biomedical technology and 
knowledge and the huge amount of research into COVID-19 raise the hope that 
a remedy for this disease will soon be found. COVID-19 will nonetheless have 
a lasting impact on human society.

Today, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health emergency 
and vaccination measures to counter its diffusion are deemed necessary. Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of 
the disease, unleashes a T-helper 2 immune response in those patients requiring 
intensive care. Here, we illustrate the immunological mechanism to train the 
immune system towards a more effective and less symptomatic T-helper 1 immune 
response, to be exploited against SARS-CoV-2.

The COVID-19 pandemic is shining a spotlight on the field of immunology like 
never before. To appreciate the diverse ways in which immunologists have 
contributed, Nature Reviews Immunology invited the president of the 
International Union of Immunological Societies and the presidents of 15 other 
national immunology societies to discuss how they and their members responded 
following the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2).

Update of
    bioRxiv. 2020 May 20;:

There is an urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics to prevent and treat 
COVID-19. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 countermeasure development is contingent on the 
availability of robust, scalable, and readily deployable surrogate viral assays 
to screen antiviral humoral responses, define correlates of immune protection, 
and down-select candidate antivirals. Here, we generate a highly infectious 
recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
glycoprotein S as its sole entry glycoprotein and show that this recombinant 
virus, rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S, closely resembles SARS-CoV-2 in its entry-related 
properties. The neutralizing activities of a large panel of COVID-19 
convalescent sera can be assessed in a high-throughput fluorescent reporter 
assay with rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S, and neutralization of rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S and 
authentic SARS-CoV-2 by spike-specific antibodies in these antisera is highly 
correlated. Our findings underscore the utility of rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S for the 
development of spike-specific therapeutics and for mechanistic studies of viral 
entry and its inhibition.

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has made deployment of an effective 
vaccine a global health priority. We evaluated the protective activity of a 
chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding a prefusion stabilized spike 
protein (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) in challenge studies with severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mice expressing the human 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Intramuscular dosing of 
ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune 
responses and protects against lung infection, inflammation, and pathology but 
does not confer sterilizing immunity, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA and 
induction of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In 
contrast, a single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces high levels of 
neutralizing antibodies, promotes systemic and mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) 
and T cell responses, and almost entirely prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in both 
the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Intranasal administration of 
ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S is a candidate for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
transmission and curtailing pandemic spread.

Humanity is experiencing a catastrophic pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally 
to cause significant morbidity and mortality, and there still remain unknowns 
about the biology and pathology of the virus. Even with testing, tracing, and 
social distancing, many countries are struggling to contain SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 
will only be suppressible when herd immunity develops, either because of an 
effective vaccine or if the population has been infected and is resistant to 
reinfection. There is virtually no chance of a return to pre-COVID-19 societal 
behavior until there is an effective vaccine. Concerted efforts by physicians, 
academic laboratories, and companies around the world have improved detection 
and treatment and made promising early steps, developing many vaccine candidates 
at a pace that has been unmatched for prior diseases. As of August 11, 2020, 28 
of these companies have advanced into clinical trials with Moderna, CanSino, the 
University of Oxford, BioNTech, Sinovac, Sinopharm, Anhui Zhifei Longcom, 
Inovio, Novavax, Vaxine, Zydus Cadila, Institute of Medical Biology, and the 
Gamaleya Research Institute having moved beyond their initial safety and 
immunogenicity studies. This review analyzes these frontrunners in the vaccine 
development space and delves into their posted results while highlighting the 
role of the nanotechnologies applied by all the vaccine developers.

The COVID-19 positive cases are increasing at an alarming rate across the world. 
On the contrary, the morbidity and mortality are showing decreasing trend as 
time progresses. The most intriguing part is the rise in asymptomatic Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive cases in the 
population, which made us speculate some kind of gradual development of immunity 
in the population. To date, no attention has been given to the accumulation of 
killed/inactivated/degenerated SARS-CoV-2 associated molecular particle patterns 
(SAMPPs). In this paper, we introduced the concept of SAMMPs and its existence 
on inanimate objects is quite conceivable due to the size of SARS-CoV-2 and 
exuberant shedding of the virus in respiratory secretions. SAMPPs can come into 
the contact with mucosal surfaces and thereof associated antigen-presenting 
dendritic cells. Thus, we hypothesized the existence of SAMPPs mediated the 
development of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which has caused an 
increase in the incidence rate of asymptomatic cases and a decrease in mortality 
rate. To understand the existence of SAMPPs associated natural immunity against 
SARS-CoV-2, future population based serological testing are recommended to 
investigate serum antibody levels against various molecular particles associated 
with SAMPPs.

In this paper, we aim to underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of 
vaccine non-adopters. As the availability of vaccines does not translate into 
their de facto adoption-a phenomenon that may be more pronounced amid "Operation 
Warp Speed"-it is important for public health professionals to thoroughly 
understand their "customers" (i.e., end users of COVID-19 vaccines) to ensure 
satisfactory vaccination rates and to safeguard society at large.

As Covid-19 spreads across the world, governments turn a hopeful eye towards 
research and development of a vaccine against this new disease. But it is one 
thing to make a vaccine available, and it is quite another to convince the 
public to take the shot, as the precedent of the 2009 H1N1 influenza 
illustrated. In this paper, we present the results of four online surveys 
conducted in April 2020 in representative samples of the French population 18 
years of age and over (N = 5018). These surveys were conducted during a period 
when the French population was on lockdown and the daily number of deaths 
attributed to the virus reached its peak. We found that if a vaccine against the 
new coronavirus became available, almost a quarter of respondents would not use 
it. We also found that attitudes to this vaccine were correlated significantly 
with political partisanship and engagement with the political system. Attitudes 
towards this future vaccine did not follow the traditional mapping of political 
attitudes along a Left-Right axis. The rift seems to be between people who feel 
close to governing parties (Centre, Left and Right) on the one hand, and, on the 
other, people who feel close to Far-Left and Far-Right parties as well as people 
who do not feel close to any party. We draw on the French sociological 
literature on ordinary attitudes to politics to discuss our results as well as 
the cultural pathways via which political beliefs can affect perceptions of 
vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in a modern era, there is a global consensus on the 
need for the rapid development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for effective and 
sustainable control. Developing these vaccines is fundamental to public health. 
This urgent need is supported by the scientific explosion in structural and 
genomic biology that facilitates the urgent development of an ideal COVID-19 
vaccine, using new pathways to facilitate its large-scale development, testing, 
and manufacture. Here, we summarize the types of COVID-19 candidate vaccines, 
their current stage in early testing in human clinical trials, and the 
challenges for their implementation.

BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
infections and the resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have 
spread to millions of people globally. Multiple vaccine candidates are under 
development, but no vaccine is currently available.
METHODS: Healthy adults 18-55 and 65-85 years of age were randomized in an 
ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose-escalation study to receive 2 
doses at 21-day intervals of placebo or either of 2 lipid 
nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, 
which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain, or 
BNT162b2, which encodes a prefusion stabilized membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 
full-length spike. In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 received vaccine 
and 3 received placebo. Groups were distinguished by vaccine candidate, age of 
participant, and vaccine dose level. Interim safety and immunogenicity data of 
BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from US and German 
trials. We now present additional safety and immunogenicity data from the US 
Phase 1 trial that supported selection of the vaccine candidate advanced to a 
pivotal Phase 2/3 safety and efficacy evaluation.
RESULTS: In both younger and older adults, the 2 vaccine candidates elicited 
similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs), 
comparable to or higher than the GMT of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera. 
BNT162b2 was associated with less systemic reactogenicity, particularly in older 
adults.
CONCLUSION: These results support selection of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate 
for Phase 2/3 large-scale safety and efficacy evaluation, currently underway.

An effective vaccine is needed to halt the spread of the severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Recently, we reported 
safety, tolerability and antibody response data from an ongoing 
placebo-controlled, observer-blinded phase I/II coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) vaccine trial with BNT162b1, a lipid nanoparticle-formulated 
nucleoside-modified mRNA that encodes the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the 
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein1. Here we present antibody and T cell responses after 
vaccination with BNT162b1 from a second, non-randomized open-label phase I/II 
trial in healthy adults, 18-55 years of age. Two doses of 1-50 μg of BNT162b1 
elicited robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and strong antibody responses, 
with RBD-binding IgG concentrations clearly above those seen in serum from a 
cohort of individuals who had recovered from COVID-19. Geometric mean titres of 
SARS-CoV-2 serum-neutralizing antibodies on day 43 were 0.7-fold (1-μg dose) to 
3.5-fold (50-μg dose) those of the recovered individuals. Immune sera broadly 
neutralized pseudoviruses with diverse SARS-CoV-2 spike variants. Most 
participants had T helper type 1 (TH1)-skewed T cell immune responses with 
RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell expansion. Interferon-γ was produced by a 
large fraction of RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. The robust RBD-specific 
antibody, T cell and favourable cytokine responses induced by the BNT162b1 mRNA 
vaccine suggest that it has the potential to protect against COVID-19 through 
multiple beneficial mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: The pandemic situation of SARS-CoV-2 infection has sparked global 
concern due to the disease COVID-19 caused by it. Since the first cluster of 
confirmed cases in China in December 2019, the infection has been reported 
across the continents and inflicted upon a substantial number of populations.
METHOD: This study is focused on immunoinformatics analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 
spike glycoprotein (S protein) which is key for the viral attachment to human 
host cells. Computational analyses were carried out for the prediction of B-cell 
and T-cell (MHC class I and II) epitopes of S protein and the analyses were 
extended further for the prediction of their immunogenic properties. The 
interaction and binding affinity of T-cell epitopes with HLA-B7 were also 
investigated by molecular docking.
RESULT: Three distinct epitopes for vaccine design were predicted from the 
sequence of S protein. The potential B-cell epitope was KNHTSPDVDLG possessing 
the highest antigenicity score of 1.4039 among other B-cell epitopes. T-cell 
epitope for human MHC class I was VVVLSFELL with an antigenicity score of 1.0909 
and binding ability to 29 MHC-I alleles. The predicted T-cell epitope for human 
MHC class II molecule was VVIGIVNNT with a corresponding 1.3063 antigenicity 
score, less digesting enzymes, and 7 MHC-II alleles binding ability. All these 
three peptides were predicted to be highly antigenic, non-allergenic, and 
non-toxic. Analyses of the physiochemical properties of these predicted epitopes 
indicate their stable nature for plausible vaccine design. Furthermore, 
molecular docking investigation between the MHC class-I epitopes and human 
HLA-B7 reflects the stable interaction with high affinity among them.
CONCLUSION: The present study posits three potential epitopes of S protein of 
SARS-CoV-2 predicted by immunoinformatic methods based on their immunogenic 
properties and interactions with the host counterpart that can facilitate the 
development of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. This study can act as the springboard 
for the future development of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Why the lower reported prevalence of asthma in patients diagnosed with COVID-19

There currently is no specific antiviral drug or a vaccine for 
SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infections; now exceeding 10,300,000 infections worldwide. 
In the absence of animal models to test drugs, we need to find molecular 
explanations for any unforeseen peculiarities in clinical data, especially the 
recent reports describing an unexpected asthma paradox. Asthma is considered a 
high medical risk factor for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection, 
yet asthma is not on the list of top 10 chronic health problems suffered by 
people who died from SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Resolving this paradox requires 
looking beyond the binary model of a viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) 
attaching to the ACE-2 receptor. A NCBI pBlast analysis revealed that the 
SARS-CoV-2 surface spike protein contains key two calcium-dependent fusion 
domains that are almost identical to those that were recently discovered 
SARS-CoV-1. These viral calcium-dependent binding domains can facilitate 
membrane fusion only after cleavage by the host surface protease TMPRSS2. 
Importantly, TMPRSS2 also requires calcium for its SRCR (scavenger receptor 
cysteine-rich) domain and itsLDLRA(LDL receptor class A) domain. Thus, the 
presence of EDTA excipients in nebulized β2-agonist medicines can disrupt 
SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection and can explain the asthma paradox. This model 
validates repurposing EDTA in nebulizer solutions from a passive excipient to an 
active drug for treating COVID-19 infections. Repurposed EDTA delivery to 
respiratory tissues at an initial target dose of 2.4 mg per aerosol treatment is 
readily achievable with standard nebulizer and mechanical ventilator equipment. 
EDTA warrants further investigation as a potential treatment for 
SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in consideration of the new calcium requirements for virus 
infection and the regular presence of EDTA excipients in common asthma 
medications such as Metaproterenol. Finally, the natural history of Coronavirus 
diseases and further analysis of the fusion loop homologies between the 
Betacorona SARS-CoV-2 virus and the less pathogenic Alphacorona HC0V-229E virus 
suggest how to engineer a hybrid virus suitable for an attenuated alpha-beta 
SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine. Thus, replacing SARS-CoV-2 fusion loops (amino 
acids 816-855) with the less pathogenic HCoV-229E fusion loop (amino acids 
923-982) may provide antigenicity of COVID-19, but limit the pathogenicity to 
the level of HCoV-229E.

Modeling Dynamic Network Strategies for SARS-CoV-2 Control on a Cruise Ship.

Jenness SM, Willebrand KS, Malik AA, Lopman BA, Omer SB.

SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have occurred on several nautical vessels, driven by the 
high-density contact networks on these ships. Optimal strategies for prevention 
and control that account for realistic contact networks are needed. We developed 
a network-based transmission model for SARS-CoV-2 on the Diamond Princess 
outbreak to characterize transmission dynamics and to estimate the 
epidemiological impact of outbreak control and prevention measures. This model 
represented the dynamic multi-layer network structure of passenger-passenger, 
passenger-crew, and crew-crew contacts, both before and after the large-scale 
network lockdown imposed on the ship in response to the disease outbreak. Model 
scenarios evaluated variations in the timing of the network lockdown, reduction 
in contact intensity within the sub-networks, and diagnosis-based case isolation 
on outbreak prevention. We found that only extreme restrictions in contact 
patterns during network lockdown and idealistic clinical response scenarios 
could avert a major COVID-19 outbreak. Contact network changes associated with 
adequate outbreak prevention were the restriction of passengers to their cabins, 
with limited passenger-crew contacts. Clinical response strategies required for 
outbreak prevention included early mass screening with an ideal PCR test (100% 
sensitivity) and immediate case isolation upon diagnosis. Public health 
restrictions on optional leisure activities like these should be considered 
until longer-term effective solutions such as a COVID-19 vaccine become widely 
available.

IMPORTANCE: As schools consider reopening for in-person instruction prior to 
availability of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, families may be 
weighing their priorities regarding school attendance.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the association of planned in-person school 
attendance during the COVID-19 pandemic with factors, including family 
socioeconomic characteristics, and parent attitudes and beliefs about their 
child's school attendance.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional survey study. Data were 
collected from June 2, 2020, to June 5, 2020, weighted to reflect population 
norms, and analyzed using ordered probit regression. A sample of US parents (of 
children ages 5-17 years) were recruited using a nonprobability survey panel 
with stratification by socioeconomic characteristics.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was parent-reported plan to send 
their child to school or keep their child home, conditional on their school 
opening for in-person instruction. Additional measures assessed family 
socioeconomic characteristics, medical vulnerability, worry about COVID-19 and 
multisystem inflammatory syndrome, confidence in their child's school, and 
homeschooling difficulties.
RESULTS: The sample of 730 parents was balanced by parent sex (53% women) with 
successful oversampling for Black (28%; n = 201) and Hispanic (27%; n = 200) 
participants. In estimates weighted to US population norms, 31% (95% CI, 27% to 
34%) of participants indicated they would probably or definitely keep their 
child home this fall, and 49% indicated that they would probably or definitely 
send their child to school this fall. Factors associated with planning to keep 
children home included lower income (38% with incomes <$50 000 vs 21% with 
incomes $100 000-$150 000 per year; difference, 17%; 95% CI, 9% to 26%), being 
unemployed (40% unemployed vs 26% employed; difference, 14%; 95% CI, 5% to 25%), 
and having a flexible job (33% with flexible jobs vs 19% with inflexible jobs; 
difference, 14%; 95% CI, 5% to 30%). Planning to keep children home was also 
associated with fear of COVID-19 (B = 0.19; P < .001), fear of multisystem 
inflammatory syndrome (B = 0.12; P = .04), confidence in schools (B = -0.22; 
P < .001), and challenges of homeschooling (B = -0.12; P = .01). Race and 
ethnicity were not significantly associated with plans to keep children home.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study, many parents planned to keep 
children home in fall 2020. Schools need to act soon to address parental 
concerns and provide options for what will be available for them should they opt 
to keep their child home. Structural barriers, such as lack of workplace 
flexibility and potential school-level inequities in implementation of 
preventive measures, must be acknowledged and addressed where possible.

BACKGROUND: Within 4 months of COVID-19 first being reported in the USA, it 
spread to every state and to more than 90% of all counties. During this period, 
the US COVID-19 response was highly decentralised, with stay-at-home directives 
issued by state and local officials, subject to varying levels of enforcement. 
The absence of a centralised policy and timeline combined with the complex 
dynamics of human mobility and the variable intensity of local outbreaks makes 
assessing the effect of large-scale social distancing on COVID-19 transmission 
in the USA a challenge.
METHODS: We used daily mobility data derived from aggregated and anonymised cell 
(mobile) phone data, provided by Teralytics (Zürich, Switzerland) from Jan 1 to 
April 20, 2020, to capture real-time trends in movement patterns for each US 
county, and used these data to generate a social distancing metric. We used 
epidemiological data to compute the COVID-19 growth rate ratio for a given 
county on a given day. Using these metrics, we evaluated how social distancing, 
measured by the relative change in mobility, affected the rate of new infections 
in the 25 counties in the USA with the highest number of confirmed cases on 
April 16, 2020, by fitting a statistical model for each county.
FINDINGS: Our analysis revealed that mobility patterns are strongly correlated 
with decreased COVID-19 case growth rates for the most affected counties in the 
USA, with Pearson correlation coefficients above 0·7 for 20 of the 25 counties 
evaluated. Additionally, the effect of changes in mobility patterns, which 
dropped by 35-63% relative to the normal conditions, on COVID-19 transmission 
are not likely to be perceptible for 9-12 days, and potentially up to 3 weeks, 
which is consistent with the incubation time of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 plus additional time for reporting. We also show evidence 
that behavioural changes were already underway in many US counties days to weeks 
before state-level or local-level stay-at-home policies were implemented, 
implying that individuals anticipated public health directives where social 
distancing was adopted, despite a mixed political message.
INTERPRETATION: This study strongly supports a role of social distancing as an 
effective way to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the USA. Until a COVID-19 
vaccine is widely available, social distancing will remain one of the primary 
measures to combat disease spread, and these findings should serve to support 
more timely policy making around social distancing in the USA in the future.

The actual effectiveness of the still-to-come vaccination against the 
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 might be challenged by vaccine hesitancy, a rather common 
and known phenomenon whose psychological predictors are, nevertheless, still 
largely debated. Our study aims at understanding how adult citizens' health 
engagement, perceived COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, and general 
vaccine-related attitudes affect the willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19. 
To that end, on a sample of Italian citizens, we implemented a path model to 
test the impact of health engagement on the willingness to vaccinate against 
SARS-CoV-2, and whether this relationship is direct or mediated by the general 
attitude towards vaccines and the risk perception. Moreover, we tested the 
configural and weak invariance of the model across gender and three age groups. 
Results show that health engagement is positively related to the intention to 
vaccinate and that this relationship is partially mediated by the general 
attitude towards vaccines. The model appears invariant across genders and 
partially invariant across age groups, showing some differences in the role of 
perceived susceptibility. These findings vouch for the implementation of 
educational campaigns aimed at sustaining future vaccination programs that also 
include health engagement promotion.

Rational Design of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins To Increase Immunogenicity By 
T Cell Epitope Engineering.

Ong E, Huang X, Pearce R, Zhang Y, He Y.

The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in millions of 
confirmed cases and thousands of deaths globally. Extensive efforts and progress 
have been made to develop effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. A 
primary target of these vaccines is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and many 
studies utilized structural vaccinology techniques to either stabilize the 
protein or fix the receptor-binding domain at certain states. In this study, we 
extended an evolutionary protein design algorithm, EvoDesign, to create 
thousands of stable S protein variants without perturbing the surface 
conformation and B cell epitopes of the S protein. We then evaluated the mutated 
S protein candidates based on predicted MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes as 
well as the epitopes' similarity to human peptides. The presented strategy aims 
to improve the S protein's immunogenicity and antigenicity by inducing stronger 
CD4 T cell response while maintaining the protein's native structure and 
function. The top EvoDesign S protein candidate (Design-10705) recovered 31 out 
of 32 MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes in the native S protein, in which two 
epitopes were present in all seven human coronaviruses. This newly designed S 
protein also introduced nine new MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes and showed 
high structural similarity to its native conformation. The proposed structural 
vaccinology method provides an avenue to rationally design the antigen's 
structure with increased immunogenicity, which could be applied to the rational 
design of new COVID-19 vaccine candidates.

Although most autoimmune diseases are considered to be CD4 T cell- or 
antibody-mediated, many respond to CD20-depleting antibodies that have limited 
influence on CD4 and plasma cells. This includes rituximab, oblinutuzumab and 
ofatumumab that are used in cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and off-label in a 
large number of other autoimmunities and ocrelizumab in multiple sclerosis. 
Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic created concerns about immunosuppression in 
autoimmunity, leading to cessation or a delay in immunotherapy treatments. 
However, based on the known and emerging biology of autoimmunity and COVID-19, 
it was hypothesised that while B cell depletion should not necessarily expose 
people to severe SARS-CoV-2-related issues, it may inhibit protective immunity 
following infection and vaccination. As such, drug-induced B cell subset 
inhibition, that controls at least some autoimmunities, would not influence 
innate and CD8 T cell responses, which are central to SARS-CoV-2 elimination, 
nor the hypercoagulation and innate inflammation causing severe morbidity. This 
is supported clinically, as the majority of SARS-CoV-2-infected, CD20-depleted 
people with autoimmunity have recovered. However, protective neutralizing 
antibody and vaccination responses are predicted to be blunted until naive B 
cells repopulate, based on B cell repopulation kinetics and vaccination 
responses, from published rituximab and unpublished ocrelizumab (NCT00676715, 
NCT02545868) trial data, shown here. This suggests that it may be possible to 
undertake dose interruption to maintain inflammatory disease control, while 
allowing effective vaccination against SARS-CoV-29, if and when an effective 
vaccine is available.

Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses known to cause illnesses that vary 
between the common cold and more severe diseases to include severe acute 
respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). A novel 
coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, 
China. This virus represents a new strain that has not been previously 
identified in humans. The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting disease is called 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) 
declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020. Despite 
rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 
continues to rise, with more than 1,948,617 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 
121,846 deaths worldwide. Currently, no specific medication is recommended to 
treat COVID-19 patients. However, governments and pharmaceutical companies are 
struggling to quickly find an effective drug to defeat the coronavirus. In the 
current review, we summarize the existing state of knowledge about COVID-19, 
available medications, and treatment options. Favilavir is an antiviral drug 
that is approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now approved to 
treat symptoms of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, Chloroquine and 
hydroxychloroquine, drugs used to treat malaria and arthritis, respectively, 
were recommended by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of 
China for treatment of COVID-19. Presently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine 
are under investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a 
treatment for COVID-19. The first COVID-19 vaccine is not expected to be ready 
for clinical trials before the end of the year.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The goal of this review is to provide a timely overview on 
efforts to develop a vaccine for the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the 
causative agent of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
RECENT FINDINGS: Previous research efforts to develop a severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) vaccine in the years following the 2003 pandemic 
have opened the door for investigators to design vaccine concepts and approaches 
for the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a high 
degree of genetic similarity and bind to the same host cell ACE2 receptor. Based 
on previous experience with SARS-CoV vaccines, it is expected that all COVID-19 
vaccines will require careful safety evaluations for immunopotentiation that 
could lead to increased infectivity or eosinophilic infiltration. Besides this, 
a COVID-19 vaccine target product profile must address vaccinating at-risk human 
populations including frontline healthcare workers, individuals over the age of 
60, and those with underlying and debilitating chronic conditions. Among the 
vaccine technologies under evaluation are whole virus vaccines, recombinant 
protein subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines.
SUMMARY: Each current vaccine strategy has distinct advantages and 
disadvantages. Therefore, it is paramount that multiple strategies be advanced 
quickly and then evaluated for safety and efficacy. Ultimately, the safety 
studies to minimize undesired immunopotentiation will become the most 
significant bottleneck in terms of time.

OBJECTIVES: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the treatment of patient with 
aortic valve stenosis is unknown and there is uncertainty on the optimal 
strategies in managing these patients.
METHODS: This study is supported and endorsed by the Asia Pacific Society of 
Interventional Cardiology. Due to the inability to have face to face discussions 
during the pandemic, an online survey was performed by inviting key opinion 
leaders (cardiac surgeon/interventional cardiologist/echocardiologist) in the 
field of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in Asia to participate. 
The answers to a series of questions pertaining to the impact of COVID-19 on 
TAVI were collected and analyzed. These led subsequently to an expert consensus 
recommendation on the conduct of TAVI during the pandemic.
RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in a 25% (10-80) reduction of case 
volume and 53% of operators required triaging to manage their patients with 
severe aortic stenosis. The two most important parameters used to triage were 
symptoms and valve area. Periprocedural changes included the introduction of 
teleconsultation, preprocedure COVID-19 testing, optimization of protests, and 
catheterization laboratory set up. In addition, length of stay was reduced from 
a mean of 4.4 to 4 days.
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the delivery of TAVI services 
to patients in Asia. This expert recommendation on best practices may be a 
useful guide to help TAVI teams during this period until a COVID-19 vaccine 
becomes widely available.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of two doses of the adsorbed vaccine 
COVID-19 (inactivated) produced by Sinovac in symptomatic individuals, with 
virological confirmation of COVID-19, two weeks after the completion of the 
two-dose vaccination regimen, aged 18 years or older who work as health 
professionals providing care to patients with possible or confirmed COVID-19. To 
describe the occurrence of adverse reactions associated with the administration 
of each of two doses of the adsorbed vaccine COVID-19 (inactivated) produced by 
Sinovac up to one week after vaccination in Adults (18-59 years of age) and 
Elderly (60 years of age or more).
TRIAL DESIGN: This is a Phase III, randomized, multicenter, endpoint driven, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy and 
safety of the adsorbed vaccine COVID-19 (inactivated) produced by Sinovac. The 
adsorbed vaccine COVID-19 (inactivated) produced by Sinovac (product under 
investigation) will be compared to placebo. Voluntary participants will be 
randomized to receive two intramuscular doses of the investigational product or 
the placebo, in a 1: 1 ratio, stratified by age group (18 to 59 years and 60 
years or more) and will be monitored for one year by active surveillance of 
COVID-19. Two databases will be established according to the age groups: one for 
adults (18-59 years) and one for the elderly (60 years of age or older). The 
threshold to consider the vaccine efficacious will be to reach a protection 
level of at least 50%, as proposed by the World Health Organization and the FDA. 
Success in this criterion will be defined by sequential monitoring with 
adjustment of the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval above 30% for the 
primary efficacy endpoint.
PARTICIPANTS: Healthy participants and / or participants with clinically 
controlled disease, of both genders, 18 years of age or older, working as health 
professionals performing care in units specialized in direct contact with people 
with possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Participation of pregnant women 
and those who are breastfeeding, as well as those intending to become pregnant 
within three months after vaccination will not be allowed. Participants will 
only be included after signing the voluntary Informed Consent Form and ensuring 
they undergo screening evaluation and conform to all the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. All the clinical sites are located in Brazil.
INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Experimental intervention: The vaccine was 
manufactured by Sinovac Life Sciences (Beijing, China) and contains 3 μg/0.5 mL 
(equivalent to 600 SU per dose) of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, and aluminium 
hydroxide as adjuvant. Control comparator: The placebo contains aluminium 
hydroxide in a 0.5 mL solution The schedule of both, experimental intervention 
and placebo is two 0.5 mL doses IM (deltoid) with a two week interval.
MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary efficacy endpoint is the incidence of symptomatic 
cases of virologically confirmed COVID-19 two weeks after the second 
vaccination. The virological diagnosis will be confirmed by detection of 
SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in a clinical sample. The primary safety endpoint is the 
frequency of solicited and unsolicited local and systemic adverse reactions 
during the period of one week after vaccination according to age group in adult 
(18-59 years old) and elder (60 years of age or older) subjects. Adverse 
reactions are defined as adverse events that have a reasonable causal 
relationship to vaccination.
RANDOMISATION: There will be two randomization lists, one for each age group, 
based on the investigational products to be administered, i.e., vaccine or 
placebo at a 1: 1 ratio. Each randomization list will be made to include up to 
11,800 (18-59 year-old) adults, and 1,260 elderly (60 y-o and older) 
participants, the maximum number of participants needed per age group. An 
electronic central randomization system will be used to designate the 
investigational product that each participant must receive.
BLINDING (MASKING): This trial is designed as a double-blind study to avoid 
introducing bias in the evaluation of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. The 
clinical care team, the professionals responsible for the vaccination and the 
participants will not know which investigational product will be administered. 
Only pharmacists or nurses in the study who are responsible for the 
randomization, separation and blinding of the investigational product will have 
access to unblinded information. The sponsor's operational team will also remain 
blind.
NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The total number of participants needed 
to evaluate efficacy, 13,060 participants, satisfies the needed sample size 
calculated to evaluate safety. Therefore, the total number obtained for efficacy 
will be the number retained for the study. Up to 13,060 participants are 
expected to enter the study, with up to 11,800 participants aged 18 to 59 years 
and 1,260 elderly participants aged 60 and over. Half of the participants of 
each group will receive the experimental vaccine and half of them will receive 
the placebo. The recruitment of participants may be modified as recommended by 
the Data Safety Monitoring Committee at time of the interim unblinded analysis 
or blind assessment of the COVID-19 attack rate during the study.
TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 2.0 - 24-Aug-2020. Recruitment started on July 
21st, 2020. The recruitment is expected to conclude in October 2020.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT0445659 . Registry on 2 
July 2020 FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, 
accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1). In the interest in 
expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been 
eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full 
protocol.

The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made the development of a 
vaccine a top biomedical priority. In this study, we developed a series of DNA 
vaccine candidates expressing different forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) 
protein and evaluated them in 35 rhesus macaques. Vaccinated animals developed 
humoral and cellular immune responses, including neutralizing antibody titers at 
levels comparable to those found in convalescent humans and macaques infected 
with SARS-CoV-2. After vaccination, all animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2, 
and the vaccine encoding the full-length S protein resulted in >3.1 and >3.7 
log10 reductions in median viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal 
mucosa, respectively, as compared with viral loads in sham controls. 
Vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibody titers correlated with protective 
efficacy, suggesting an immune correlate of protection. These data demonstrate 
vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in an unprecedented 
public health crisis. Because of the novelty of the virus, there are currently 
no SARS-CoV-2-specific treatments or vaccines available. Therefore, rapid 
development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. Here, 
we developed a pilot-scale production of PiCoVacc, a purified inactivated 
SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate, which induced SARS-CoV-2-specific 
neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats, and nonhuman primates. These antibodies 
neutralized 10 representative SARS-CoV-2 strains, suggesting a possible broader 
neutralizing ability against other strains. Three immunizations using two 
different doses, 3 or 6 micrograms per dose, provided partial or complete 
protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, respectively, without 
observable antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. These data support the 
clinical development and testing of PiCoVacc for use in humans.

BACKGROUND: The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) might be curtailed by vaccination. We assessed the safety, 
reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a viral vectored coronavirus vaccine that 
expresses the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: We did a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial in five 
trial sites in the UK of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 
nCoV-19) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared with a meningococcal 
conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) as control. Healthy adults aged 18-55 years with no 
history of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or of COVID-19-like 
symptoms were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at a dose of 
5 × 1010 viral particles or MenACWY as a single intramuscular injection. A 
protocol amendment in two of the five sites allowed prophylactic paracetamol to 
be administered before vaccination. Ten participants assigned to a 
non-randomised, unblinded ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group received a two-dose 
schedule, with the booster vaccine administered 28 days after the first dose. 
Humoral responses at baseline and following vaccination were assessed using a 
standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a 
muliplexed immunoassay, three live SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays (a 50% 
plaque reduction neutralisation assay [PRNT50]; a microneutralisation assay 
[MNA50, MNA80, and MNA90]; and Marburg VN), and a pseudovirus neutralisation 
assay. Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo interferon-γ 
enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The co-primary outcomes are to assess efficacy, 
as measured by cases of symptomatic virologically confirmed COVID-19, and 
safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were 
done by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Safety was 
assessed over 28 days after vaccination. Here, we report the preliminary 
findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. 
The study is ongoing, and was registered at ISRCTN, 15281137, and 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606.
FINDINGS: Between April 23 and May 21, 2020, 1077 participants were enrolled and 
assigned to receive either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=543) or MenACWY (n=534), ten of 
whom were enrolled in the non-randomised ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group. 
Local and systemic reactions were more common in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 
many were reduced by use of prophylactic paracetamol, including pain, feeling 
feverish, chills, muscle ache, headache, and malaise (all p<0·05). There were no 
serious adverse events related to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. In the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, 
spike-specific T-cell responses peaked on day 14 (median 856 spot-forming cells 
per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IQR 493-1802; n=43). Anti-spike 
IgG responses rose by day 28 (median 157 ELISA units [EU], 96-317; n=127), and 
were boosted following a second dose (639 EU, 360-792; n=10). Neutralising 
antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 32 (91%) of 35 
participants after a single dose when measured in MNA80 and in 35 (100%) 
participants when measured in PRNT50. After a booster dose, all participants had 
neutralising activity (nine of nine in MNA80 at day 42 and ten of ten in Marburg 
VN on day 56). Neutralising antibody responses correlated strongly with antibody 
levels measured by ELISA (R2=0·67 by Marburg VN; p<0·001).
INTERPRETATION: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed an acceptable safety profile, and 
homologous boosting increased antibody responses. These results, together with 
the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses, support large-scale 
evaluation of this candidate vaccine in an ongoing phase 3 programme.

A widely accessible vaccine is essential to mitigate the health and economic 
ravages of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Without appropriate incentives 
and coordination, however, firms might not respond at sufficient speed or scale, 
and competition among countries for limited supply could drive up prices and 
undercut efficient allocation. Programs relying on "push" incentives (direct 
cost reimbursement) can be complicated by the funder's inability to observe 
firms' private cost information. To address these challenges, we propose a 
"pull" program that incentivizes late-stage development (Phase III trials and 
manufacturing) for COVID-19 vaccines by awarding advance purchase agreements to 
bidding firms. Using novel cost and demand data, we calculated the optimal size 
and number of awards. In baseline simulations, the optimal program induced the 
participation of virtually all ten viable vaccine candidates, spending an 
average of $110 billion to generate net benefits of $2.8 trillion-nearly double 
the net benefits generated by the free market.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the novel severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared by the World 
Health Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 
targets the respiratory system, resulting in symptoms such as fever, headache, 
dry cough, dyspnea, and dizziness. These symptoms vary from person to person, 
ranging from mild to hypoxia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 
sometimes death. Although not confirmed, phylogenetic analysis suggests that 
SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from bats; the intermediary facilitating its 
transfer from bats to humans is unknown. Owing to the rapid spread of infection 
and high number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, most countries have enacted 
strict curfews and the practice of social distancing while awaiting the 
availability of effective U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved 
medications and/or vaccines. This review offers an overview of the various types 
of coronaviruses (CoVs), their targeted hosts and cellular receptors, a timeline 
of their emergence, and the roles of key elements of the immune system in 
fighting pathogen attacks, while focusing on SARS-CoV-2 and its genomic 
structure and pathogenesis. Furthermore, we review drugs targeting COVID-19 that 
are under investigation and in clinical trials, in addition to progress using 
mesenchymal stem cells to treat COVID-19. We conclude by reviewing the latest 
updates on COVID-19 vaccine development. Understanding the molecular mechanisms 
of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with host cells and stimulates the immune response 
is extremely important, especially as scientists look for new strategies to 
guide their development of specific COVID-19 therapies and vaccines.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has currently become a major global public health 
problem. The prevalence of COVID-19 has increased rapidly worldwide. Since there 
is no effective COVID-19 vaccine available yet, it is increasingly important to 
understand the average incubation period of the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to design appropriate preventive and control 
strategies. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to 
estimate the pooled average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We 
conducted a systematic electronic web-based search of online databases including 
PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and the World Health Organization's HINARI 
portal. We included peer-reviewed research studies written in the English 
language on the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 using pre-defined quality and 
inclusion criteria. STATA version 15 statistical software was used to analyze 
the data. Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal quality assessment 
tool for observational studies was utilized to evaluate the included studies. We 
extracted relevant data and presented in a tabular form. The I2 test was used to 
assess heterogeneity across studies. Funnel plot asymmetry and Egger's tests 
were used to check for publication bias. The final effect size was determined by 
applying a random-effects model. Results: Our search identified 206 studies, 
amongst which 18 studies, representing 22,595 participants were included in the 
final analysis. The pooled average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 5.7 days 
(95% CI: 5.1, 6.4). Subgroup analyses by geographic location showed that the 
pooled average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.1 days (95% CI: 5.34, 6.94) 
in China and 4.54 (95% CI: 3.9, 5.2) in other countries (Singapore, South Korea, 
and globally). Conclusion: The pooled average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 
was about six days. The longest incubation period was observed in China. The 
global health initiatives as well as local health planners should consider, this 
average incubation period while designing optimal prevention and control 
strategies for SARS-CoV-2.

A successful SARS-CoV-2 vaccine must be not only safe and protective but must 
also meet the demand on a global scale at low cost. Using the current influenza 
virus vaccine production capacity to manufacture an egg-based inactivated 
Newcastle disease virus (NDV)/SARS-CoV-2 vaccine would meet that challenge. 
Here, we report pre-clinical evaluations of an inactivated NDV chimera stably 
expressing the membrane-anchored form of the spike (NDV-S) as a potent COVID-19 
vaccine in mice and hamsters. The inactivated NDV-S vaccine was immunogenic, 
inducing strong binding and/or neutralizing antibodies in both animal models. 
More importantly, the inactivated NDV-S vaccine protected animals from 
SARS-CoV-2 infections or significantly attenuated SARS-CoV-2 induced disease. In 
the presence of an adjuvant, antigen-sparing could be achieved, which would 
further reduce the cost while maintaining the protective efficacy of the 
vaccine.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly instigated a global 
pandemic. Vaccine development is proceeding at an unprecedented pace. Once 
available, it will be important to maximize vaccine uptake and coverage.
OBJECTIVE: To assess intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 among a 
representative sample of adults in the United States and identify predictors of 
and reasons for vaccine hesitancy.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey, fielded from 16 through 20 April 2020.
SETTING: Representative sample of adults residing in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Approximately 1000 adults drawn from the AmeriSpeak 
probability-based research panel, covering approximately 97% of the U.S. 
household population.
MEASUREMENTS: Intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 was measured with the 
question, "When a vaccine for the coronavirus becomes available, will you get 
vaccinated?" Response options were "yes," "no," and "not sure." Participants who 
responded "no" or "not sure" were asked to provide a reason.
RESULTS: A total of 991 AmeriSpeak panel members responded. Overall, 57.6% of 
participants (n = 571) intended to be vaccinated, 31.6% (n = 313) were not sure, 
and 10.8% (n = 107) did not intend to be vaccinated. Factors independently 
associated with vaccine hesitancy (a response of "no" or "not sure") included 
younger age, Black race, lower educational attainment, and not having received 
the influenza vaccine in the prior year. Reasons for vaccine hesitancy included 
vaccine-specific concerns, a need for more information, antivaccine attitudes or 
beliefs, and a lack of trust.
LIMITATIONS: Participants' intent to be vaccinated was explored before a vaccine 
was available and when the pandemic was affecting a narrower swath of the United 
States. Questions about specific information or factors that might increase 
vaccination acceptance were not included. The survey response rate was 16.1%.
CONCLUSION: This national survey, conducted during the coronavirus pandemic, 
revealed that approximately 3 in 10 adults were not sure they would accept 
vaccination and 1 in 10 did not intend to be vaccinated against COVID-19. 
Targeted and multipronged efforts will be needed to increase acceptance of a 
COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available.

Clinical development of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, a 
replication-deficient simian adenoviral vector expressing the full-length 
SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein was initiated in April 2020 following non-human 
primate studies using a single immunisation. Here, we compared the 
immunogenicity of one or two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in both mice and pigs. 
Whilst a single dose induced antigen-specific antibody and T cells responses, a 
booster immunisation enhanced antibody responses, particularly in pigs, with a 
significant increase in SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres.

BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
infections and the resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), have 
spread to millions of persons worldwide. Multiple vaccine candidates are under 
development, but no vaccine is currently available. Interim safety and 
immunogenicity data about the vaccine candidate BNT162b1 in younger adults have 
been reported previously from trials in Germany and the United States.
METHODS: In an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, dose-escalation, 
phase 1 trial conducted in the United States, we randomly assigned healthy 
adults 18 to 55 years of age and those 65 to 85 years of age to receive either 
placebo or one of two lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA 
vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 
receptor-binding domain; or BNT162b2, which encodes a membrane-anchored 
SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike, stabilized in the prefusion conformation. The 
primary outcome was safety (e.g., local and systemic reactions and adverse 
events); immunogenicity was a secondary outcome. Trial groups were defined 
according to vaccine candidate, age of the participants, and vaccine dose level 
(10 μg, 20 μg, 30 μg, and 100 μg). In all groups but one, participants received 
two doses, with a 21-day interval between doses; in one group (100 μg of 
BNT162b1), participants received one dose.
RESULTS: A total of 195 participants underwent randomization. In each of 13 
groups of 15 participants, 12 participants received vaccine and 3 received 
placebo. BNT162b2 was associated with a lower incidence and severity of systemic 
reactions than BNT162b1, particularly in older adults. In both younger and older 
adults, the two vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent 
SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titers, which were similar to or higher 
than the geometric mean titer of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum 
samples.
CONCLUSIONS: The safety and immunogenicity data from this U.S. phase 1 trial of 
two vaccine candidates in younger and older adults, added to earlier interim 
safety and immunogenicity data regarding BNT162b1 in younger adults from trials 
in Germany and the United States, support the selection of BNT162b2 for 
advancement to a pivotal phase 2-3 safety and efficacy evaluation. (Funded by

The 'D614G' mutation (Aspartate-to-Glycine change at position 614) of the 
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been speculated to adversely affect the efficacy of 
most vaccines and countermeasures that target this glycoprotein, necessitating 
frequent vaccine matching. Virus neutralisation assays were performed using sera 
from ferrets which received two doses of the INO-4800 COVID-19 vaccine, and 
Australian virus isolates (VIC01, SA01 and VIC31) which either possess or lack 
this mutation but are otherwise comparable. Through this approach, supported by 
biomolecular modelling of this mutation and the commonly-associated P314L 
mutation in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, we have shown that there is no 
experimental evidence to support this speculation. We additionally demonstrate 
that the putative elastase cleavage site introduced by the D614G mutation is 
unlikely to be accessible to proteases.

Development of effective preventative interventions against SARS-CoV-2, the 
etiologic agent of COVID-19 is urgently needed. The viral surface spike (S) 
protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a key target for prophylactic measures as it is 
critical for the viral replication cycle and the primary target of neutralizing 
antibodies. We evaluated design elements previously shown for other coronavirus 
S protein-based vaccines to be successful, e.g., prefusion-stabilizing 
substitutions and heterologous signal peptides, for selection of a S-based 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. In vitro characterization demonstrated that the 
introduction of stabilizing substitutions (i.e., furin cleavage site mutations 
and two consecutive prolines in the hinge region of S2) increased the ratio of 
neutralizing versus non-neutralizing antibody binding, suggestive for a 
prefusion conformation of the S protein. Furthermore, the wild-type signal 
peptide was best suited for the correct cleavage needed for a natively folded 
protein. These observations translated into superior immunogenicity in mice 
where the Ad26 vector encoding for a membrane-bound stabilized S protein with a 
wild-type signal peptide elicited potent neutralizing humoral immunity and 
cellular immunity that was polarized towards Th1 IFN-γ. This optimized Ad26 
vector-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, termed Ad26.COV2.S, is currently being 
evaluated in a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: 
NCT04436276).

Update in
    Nat Immunol. 2020 Sep 4;:

COVID-19 is an ongoing global crisis in which the development of effective 
vaccines and therapeutics will depend critically on understanding the natural 
immunity to the virus, including the role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. We 
have conducted a study of 42 patients following recovery from COVID-19, 
including 28 mild and 14 severe cases, comparing their T cell responses to those 
of 16 control donors. We assessed the immune memory of T cell responses using 
IFNγ based assays with overlapping peptides spanning SARS-CoV-2 apart from ORF1. 
We found the breadth, magnitude and frequency of memory T cell responses from 
COVID-19 were significantly higher in severe compared to mild COVID-19 cases, 
and this effect was most marked in response to spike, membrane, and ORF3a 
proteins. Total and spike-specific T cell responses correlated with the 
anti-Spike, anti-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) as well as anti-Nucleoprotein 
(NP) endpoint antibody titre (p<0.001, <0.001 and =0.002). We identified 39 
separate peptides containing CD4 + and/or CD8 + epitopes, which strikingly 
included six immunodominant epitope clusters targeted by T cells in many donors, 
including 3 clusters in spike (recognised by 29%, 24%, 18% donors), two in the 
membrane protein (M, 32%, 47%) and one in the nucleoprotein (Np, 35%). CD8+ 
responses were further defined for their HLA restriction, including 
B*4001-restricted T cells showing central memory and effector memory phenotype. 
In mild cases, higher frequencies of multi-cytokine producing M- and NP-specific 
CD8 + T cells than spike-specific CD8 + T cells were observed. They furthermore 
showed a higher ratio of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + to CD4 + T cell responses. 
Immunodominant epitope clusters and peptides containing T cell epitopes 
identified in this study will provide critical tools to study the role of 
virus-specific T cells in control and resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The 
identification of T cell specificity and functionality associated with milder 
disease, highlights the potential importance of including non-spike proteins 
within future COVID-19 vaccine design.

Several vaccine candidates to protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have 
entered or will soon enter large-scale, phase 3, placebo-controlled randomized 
clinical trials. To facilitate harmonized evaluation and comparison of the 
efficacy of these vaccines, a general set of clinical endpoints is proposed, 
along with considerations to guide the selection of the primary endpoints on the 
basis of clinical and statistical reasoning. The plausibility that vaccine 
protection against symptomatic COVID-19 could be accompanied by a shift toward 
more SARS-CoV-2 infections that are asymptomatic is highlighted, as well as the 
potential implications of such a shift.

The development of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
vaccines and therapeutics will depend on understanding viral immunity. We 
studied T cell memory in 42 patients following recovery from COVID-19 (28 with 
mild disease and 14 with severe disease) and 16 unexposed donors, using 
interferon-γ-based assays with peptides spanning SARS-CoV-2 except ORF1. The 
breadth and magnitude of T cell responses were significantly higher in severe as 
compared with mild cases. Total and spike-specific T cell responses correlated 
with spike-specific antibody responses. We identified 41 peptides containing 
CD4+ and/or CD8+ epitopes, including six immunodominant regions. Six optimized 
CD8+ epitopes were defined, with peptide-MHC pentamer-positive cells displaying 
the central and effector memory phenotype. In mild cases, higher proportions of 
SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells were observed. The identification of T cell 
responses associated with milder disease will support an understanding of 
protective immunity and highlights the potential of including non-spike proteins 
within future COVID-19 vaccine design.
